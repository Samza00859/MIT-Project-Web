He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives.\n\nJPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years.\n\nEarlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack.\n\nThe president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\n“Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.”\n\nTrump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion.\n\nDimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: \"Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers.\n\n\"It would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy,\" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank’s earnings call last Tuesday.", "score": 5946, "num_comments": 693, "over_18": false, "author": "BusyHands_"}

The usual argument is that the US deserves a \"Trust Premium.\" We have the stable government, the reserve currency, and the predictable policy. You pay a luxury tax for US stocks because it's the safe haven.\n\nBut that trust is evaporating. We are watching the stability of the US erode in real time. With Trump's erratic behavior and policy by tweet, the \"predictable\" part of the US thesis is gone.\n\nIf the US acts like a volatile emerging market, it shouldn't trade at a safety premium. Why pay 20x or 25x earnings for slow growth US companies when the political risk is skyrocketing?\n\nThe real asymmetry is abroad.\n\n\\- China: You have tech monopolies with actual growth trading at 8x or 9x earnings.\n\n\\- South America/Europe: Massive discounts.\n\n\\- US: You pay a huge premium for \"safety\" while the political landscape gets more irrational by the day.\n\nThe valuation gap is closing, and it will continue to close as long as we have the DUmp in the white house.\n\nThis is why I think looking for \"value\" in the US right now is a mistake. People keep asking if beaten down stocks like PYPL or ADBE are value plays. They aren't. US market will probably continue to be on a relative decline (which has been for the last year) as long as the current policies persists.\n\nEDIT:\n\n1. Relative decline means that US market went up significantly less than ex-US markets. Case in point VXUS is up 30% over the last year while VTI is up less than 15%.  Taking into account of USD value dropping, US stock market has barely moved up over the last year for many international investors.\n\n2. People are right to point out about MAG7 companies and US still holds a lead technologically and still have the dynamism edge.\n\nBut looking long term, I think we're coasting on momentum and eating our seed corn. The foundations that built that advantage are eroding:\n\n\\- Education is slipping. You can't have tech dominance without a skilled workforce, and we are failing to produce it locally. US math scores in rankings dropped 30th place worldwide. We're relying entirely on importing talent, which Trump is doing his best to discourage.\n\n\\- Basic research is drying up. The \"inventing\" part used to be funded by the government (Internet, GPS, early biotech). Federal R&D spend has crashed. Corporations do R&D now, but they focus on next quarter's profit, not the deep science that creates the next industry.\n\nWe are great at harvesting the crop right now, but we stopped planting the next field.", "score": 3769, "num_comments": 756, "over_18": false, "author": "TraditionalMango58"}

Canada is forging a “new strategic partnership” with China, its second-biggest trading partner, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday during what he called a “historic” trip to Beijing. That includes a break with the United States on tariffs, which have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China since 2017, met with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People. He is one of a series of world leaders shaken by President Donald Trump’s geopolitical disruptions who are traveling to Beijing as it seeks to exploit U.S. unpredictability to bolster its global influence. For Canada, the Trump administration has been especially head-spinning. “The United States used to be a friend and ally,” Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, told NBC News in an interview. Now, “we are treated as an enemy.”\n\n> As part of an effort to “recalibrate” the relationship, Carney said Canada had agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products. It’s a major shift for Canada, a major auto producer that in 2024 followed the U.S. in imposing the 100% tariff. Carney said Canadians would also be allowed to travel to China visa-free.\n\n> Canadian officials say they are seeking to grow non-U.S. trade by at least 50% over the next 10 years. “Further trade engagement with China should first and foremost be seen as diversification away from the United States,” Ong said. About 75% of Canada’s manufactured goods exports go to the U.S., according to government figures.

If you listened to me in late December, you should now be up around 45% YTD holding long. Here is my next piece as we continue to track global events and the rare earths bananza continues to take hold:\n\n——\n\n**My portfolio (UUUU, MP, CCJ, LYC, LEU)** is not a bet on higher spot prices. It is a bet on physical bottlenecks colliding with geopolitics, energy security, and capital rotation. The market is still underestimating how violent that collision will be.\n\nThe desire for Greenland is not reckless, it was inevitable. It is the visible phase of a transition that was locked in years ago….\n\nWe are entering a period where governments and utilities will pay whatever they must to secure supply of rare earths and materials. When that happens equity repricing does not happen gradually. It happens all at once. Like a fucking Hurricane.\n\n**The Macro Thesis**\n\nI. Energy security has replaced cost efficiency.\n\nII. China’s dominance is now politically intolerable.\n\nIII. Supply chains cannot be rebuilt on demand.\n\nIV. Demand is inelastic and accelerating.\n\nV. Capital is rotating away from over owned growth and toward physical chokepoints.\n\nGreenland was the accelerant not the cause.\n\nThe moment Greenland entered the geopolitical spotlight markets were reminded of a simple truth - just like Venezuela. **The West does not control the materials it needs to function**. That realization does not lead to negotiation. It leads to stockpiling long term contracts and panic bidding.\n\n**Why This Was Set in Stone Years Ago China Won Africa**\n\nNone of this started in Greenland.\n\nGreenland is the flashpoint not the origin.\n\nThe origin was a twenty year strategic campaign where China secured the physical foundation of the global economy while the West assumed markets and interdependence would enable the continuation of their growth and supremacy.\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s China made a deliberate choice. Control the inputs not the brands.\n\nWhile the West shut down processing, delayed permits, financialized commodities and treated minerals as cyclical trades, China invested directly in mines, built roads, ports and rail while using state backed capital for long term access to resources.\n\n**Africa was the centerpiece.**\n\nAcross the DRC, Zambia, Namibia, Guinea, Zimbabwe and beyond, China locked up cobalt, copper, lithium, rare earths manganese, and graphite, not through spot markets but through multi decade offtake agreements and state to state deals the West refused to touch (because were politically correct pansies playing a game against realists who understood this mineral war years ago).\n\nOnce those contracts were signed the game was over. The molecules were spoken for. China now controls the majority of rare earths. We’re fucked and now we’re panicking.\n\n**The West’s Mistake and Why It Cannot Be Fixed Quickly**\n\n1). The West assumed supply would always be available.\n\n2). That China would remain a neutral trade partner.\n\n3). That ESG frameworks and markets could replace strategy.\n\nBy the time policymakers woke up the supply chain had already hardened.\n\nYou cannot rebuild mines in two years.\n\nYou cannot rebuild processing in three.\n\nYou cannot recreate workforce expertise overnight.\n\nYou cannot manufacture social license on demand.\n\nChina did not win because it was smarter. It won because it was earlier and planned for the long term future.\n\n**What we are watching now is not a transition. It is a forced unwind of a twenty year mistake.** Emergency funding long term contracts, ensuring strategic stockpiles and national security exemptions are all symptoms of the same realization. Time no longer exists.\n\n**Why Greenland Changed Everything**\n\nGreenland forced the issue into the open.\n\nIt reminded markets and policymakers that strategic minerals are geographically constrained, that supply chains are political, and that China already made its move.\n\nThis is not a new arms race. It is the late innings of one that already began. When time disappears price stops mattering.\n\n**The Companies and the Bottlenecks They Control (and how to make money from this)**\n\nThis portfolio (UUUU, MP, CCJ, LYC, & LEU) is not a collection of commodity stocks. *It is a collection of chokepoint owners.*\n\n**Energy Fuels** controls one of the only domestic pathways in the United States for converting uranium into usable nuclear fuel and separating rare earth oxides. Mining without processing is irrelevant. Processing is the bottleneck. As supply nationalism accelerates Energy Fuels becomes policy infrastructure not a trade.\n\n**Cameco** sits at the center of Western uranium supply. Utilities do not want exposure to geopolitics. They want certainty. Cameco controls scalable politically acceptable supply at the exact moment utilities are pulling contracts forward and locking volumes for decades. This is not price leverage. It is contract leverage.\n\n**Centrus** controls enrichment. Mining is step one. Enrichment is the gate. SMRs require HALEU. HALEU barely exists. Russia dominates enrichment and that is no longer acceptable. Centrus is not leveraged to spot uranium. It is leveraged to national security timelines.\n\n**MP Materials** controls the only large scale rare earth mine in the United States. No mine means no supply. No supply means no EVs no defense systems no AI hardware. Processing will follow but mining is the choke.\n\n**Lynas** is the only meaningful rare earth processor outside China. That single fact makes it irreplaceable. In a real supply crisis Lynas does not compete. It gets allocated.\n\nYTD, this portfolio is up 40%. Tomorrow (and for the rest of Q1 and beyond) we should expect another major rally.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThis is not a meme stock play. This is structural.

We had high trust.\n\nThat trust is evaporating. When the US political system looks erratic, foreign governments stop seeing Microsoft or Google as neutral tools.

It's that we are permanently damaging the infrastructure of trust that allows US tech to print money globally. Trust is hard to build and easy to lose.

If you were evaluating an equity's fundamental value, this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before. This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down, combined with #3.\n\n>**4.1)** The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates, but in any case, this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it. This would just hyper-charge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds.\n\n**5)** Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to Denmark/Greenland, it's effectively injected the global economy with $1-2T of debt, strongly raising the likelihood of inflation. Remember it's also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors (student loans, land rights, etc.), which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes, budget cuts, or everyone's favorite, more debt - i.e., more inflation, higher debt-to-GDP ratio, higher rates, and more equity (and likely bond market) depression.\n\n>**5.1)** A small, nuanced point, but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle, which, if priced incorrectly would essentially 'create money,' also driving up money supply and possibly long-term inflation.\n\n**6)** Higher rates, greater inflation, and depressed equity/bond markets leaves one trade left for investors, i.e. a debasement trade in hard assets like gold/silver. Of course, gold/silver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollar/sell off for cash (won't get into emerging market dynamics here, but you can guess), but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets.\n\n**Takeaway)** This is highly speculative, and the future is anything but predictable. But the truth is that the US probably doesn't have the firepower to finance this thing, and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies there's no way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation (which itself jacks up rates). I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell, likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in, at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like gold/silver should begin to climb. High rates risk Fed action, and even if the Fed does bring rates down, any subsequent QE-induced inflation stands to depress bond/equity valuations in this type of environment.\n\n>**Note 1)** I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland. If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner, i.e., essentially immediately, then perhaps there is no excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap rates/covering cash-flow holes. I do think, though, regardless, the effect of issuing high-rate bonds to pull cash-flows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events. Plus, and ROI from Greenland would take decades, well after the inflation has sunk in.\n\n>**Note 2)** There is the possibility that the political crisis this has/will cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US, which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy - but their interlinkage is so strong, I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic.", "score": 225, "num_comments": 256, "over_18": false, "author": "mrmdavid"}

Amaroq Minerals ($AMRQ)**\n\n* **Thesis:** Amaroq has successfully transitioned from \"explorer\" to \"producer,\" recently beating FY25 gold production guidance. The real story is strategic: The West is desperate to secure critical minerals (Gold/Copper) outside of Chinese influence, and Amaroq effectively owns the rights to South Greenland.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** The Phase 2 plant upgrade lands in Q2 2026. This boosts recovery rates to \\~90%, turning this into a cash-flow machine just as gold prices hold historic highs.\n\n**2. Ferrari ($RACE)**\n\n* **Thesis:** Stop looking at P/E ratios; this trades like Hermès, not Ford. The order book is entirely sold out through 2026. Their customer base is immune to interest rates and inflation, and they have arguably the strongest pricing power of any company on earth.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** Lewis Hamilton’s second season in Red + the imminent launch of their first EV. The market expects the EV to be sold out before the public even sees it.\n\n**3. Aston Martin ($AML)**\n\n* **Thesis:** The contrarian pick. The stock has been battered, creating a distressed valuation (0.4x sales). The thesis relies entirely on the successful delivery of the *Valhalla* supercar in 2026 and debt stabilization.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** If they deliver cars on time this year, the stock re-rates from \"bankruptcy risk\" to \"luxury brand.\" High risk, massive potential upside.\n\n**4. Fluor ($FLR)**\n\n* **Thesis:** Fluor has \"de-risked\" its backlog, 82% of its contracts are now reimbursable (meaning the client pays for cost overruns, not Fluor). They are the ones actually building the data centers for hyperscalers and have a massive footprint in the Nuclear/SMR renaissance.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** Aggressive share buybacks continuing through Feb 2026 and the monetization of their NuScale (SMR) stake.\n\n**5. L3Harris ($LHX)**\n\n* **Thesis:** Unlike the slow-moving \"metal benders\" (Lockheed/Northrop), LHX focuses on the high-growth tech layer of defense: space, cyber, and comms. They are the \"trusted disruptor\" in a sector seeing increased budget allocation.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** The planned spin-off of their Missile Solutions unit later in 2026. This unlocks shareholder value and leaves a leaner, higher-margin tech core.\n\n**6. Capital One ($COF)**\n\n* **Thesis:** The play is the Discover acquisition. By owning the Discover network, COF creates a closed-loop system (issuer + network) that lets them bypass Visa/Mastercard fees and capture the entire transaction margin. Even without it, it’s a tech-forward bank trading at a value multiple. (10% C/C Cap Highly Unlikely to go through)\n* **2026 Catalyst:** Realizing the projected $2.7B in synergies.\n\n**7. NextEra Energy ($NEE)**\n\n* **Thesis:** AI Data centers consume an insane amount of electricity. NextEra is the largest renewable developer in the US and the only one with the scale (\\~30GW backlog) to power the AI boom. You get the safety of a regulated utility (Florida Power & Light) attached to a high-growth tech play.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** Confirmed 10% dividend growth through 2026 and massive demand from hyperscalers (Google/Microsoft) signing long-term power purchase agreements.", "score": 127, "num_comments": 39, "over_18": false, "author": "TheRaul5677070"}

I mostly stick to equities, ETFs, and some crypto. But given the current political and macro backdrop, I’m starting to question whether ignoring gold and silver right now is actually the bigger risk.\n\nGold and silver have been in a very strong uptrend over the past days and weeks. Gold is trading around $4,675–$4,690/oz, up roughly +1.8% to +1.9% today, while silver is near $94/oz, up +5% to +6.6% today. Silver has been especially volatile, up about +25% YTD (2026) and roughly +200% over the past year.\n\nFrom a macro perspective, this looks like a classic **safe-haven rally**, driven by several overlapping factors:\n\n* **Geopolitical tensions**: renewed trade-war risks, US–Europe tariff threats, and broader instability are pushing investors toward defensive assets.\n* **Macro uncertainty**: a weaker US dollar, uncertainty around Fed leadership and rate cuts, persistent inflation, and rising global debt levels.\n* **Central bank behavior**: continued strong gold purchases, especially from China, as part of reserve diversification.\n* **Silver-specific dynamics**: rising industrial demand (electrification, AI infrastructure, crypto-related hardware), structural supply deficits, export restrictions, and its classification as a critical mineral in the US.\n\nSome analysts (Citi, JPMorgan) are talking about **$5,000 gold** and **$100 silver** into 2026, though that obviously comes with downside risks. A pullback from profit-taking seems very possible after such a sharp move, even if the broader trend remains bullish.\n\nI’m personally conflicted. On one hand, this feels late in the move. On the other, if the political and macro situation deteriorates further, not having any exposure to precious metals could be a blind spot in my portfolio.\n\nI’m not looking at physical metals, but rather trading exposure, which makes it easier to follow institutional flows and manage risk. That said, I’m aware metals behave very differently from equities and crypto. Even crypto platforms, Bitget, for example, now offer gold and silver trading through their TradFi products, which I’ve already tested from a trading perspective.

Despite bans and active crackdowns by authorities, an estimated 50,000 smuggled terminals remain in use).\n\n  \nHowever, this time I’m clearly talking about investing rather than short-term trading, which is why I’m approaching it differently.\n\nCurious to hear how others here are thinking about this:\n\n* Are gold and silver still effective hedges at these levels?\n* Is this a structural shift, or just a crowded trade waiting for a correction?\n* How (if at all) are you integrating metals into a portfolio that’s otherwise equity-heavy?\n\nNot looking for predictions, just thoughtful perspectives.", "score": 113, "num_comments": 162, "over_18": false, "author": "TowelNo234"}
