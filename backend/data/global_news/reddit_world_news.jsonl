Paramount, meanwhile, has sweetened its $77.9 billion offer for the entire company and gone straight to shareholders with a hostile bid.\n\n>Warner Bros. Discovery said Wednesday that its board determined Paramount’s offer is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. It again recommended shareholders support the Netflix deal.\n\n>“Paramount’s offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed,\" Warner Bros. Discovery Chair Samuel Di Piazza Jr. said in a statement. \"Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount’s offer would impose on our shareholders.”\n\n>Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>Late last month Paramount announced an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from Oracle founder Larry Ellison — who is the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison — to back $40.4 billion in equity financing for the company’s offer. Paramount also increased its promised payout to shareholders to $5.8 billion if the deal is blocked by regulators, matching what Netflix already put on the table.\n\n>In a letter to shareholders, Warner expressed concerns about a potential deal with Paramount. It said it essentially considers the offer a leveraged buyout, which includes a lot of debt, and that it could take 12 to 18 months to close a deal.\n\n>The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount wants the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes networks like CNN and Discovery.\n\n>If Netflix is successful, Warner’s news and cable operations would be spun off into their own company, under a previously-announced separation.\n\n>A merger with either company will attract tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Due to its size and potential impact, it will almost certainly trigger a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which could sue to block the transaction or request changes. Other countries and regulators overseas may also challenge the merger.", "score": 4256, "num_comments": 213, "over_18": false, "author": "callsonreddit"}

In it he pledged to block defense contractors from paying dividends or buying back shares until they accelerated production.\n\nTrump said the extra spending would be covered by revenues generated by tariffs he has imposed on nearly every country and many industrial sectors, and the U.S. would still be able to reduce its debt and send dividend checks to \"moderate income\" Americans.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated the proposal would cost $5 trillion through 2035, while adding $5.8 trillion to the U.S. debt with interest. It said only half the cost could be covered by tariffs in place now, noting that the Supreme Court could rule that a large set of tariffs were illegal.\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that combined tariffs raised $288 billion in 2025, well below Trump's own estimates, which have fluctuated around $600 billion in recent days.", "score": 3259, "num_comments": 588, "over_18": false, "author": "vishesh_07_028"}

The country's GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through:\n\n• Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth\n\n• Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse\n\n• Rebasing exercises that only ever \"discover\" growth, never decline\n\n• Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals.\n\nWhen intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy.\n\nThe first Pillar: Energy Delusion\n\nYou cannot run a $250-billion economy on Nigeria's electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services. The numbers don't compute, they're physically impossible. Here's some context:\n\n|A|**B**|\n|:-|:-|\n|Nigeria electricity per capita|**\\~140-180 kWh/year**|\n|Sub-Saharan Africa average|\\~400 kWh/year|\n|Brazil (for comparison)|\\~3,295 kWh/year|\n|Peak grid generation (March 2025)|**5,801 MW (celebrated as record)**|\n|Private generator capacity|\\~14,000 MW (half of all consumption)|\n\nEven the claimed figures are likely exaggerated.\n\nEnergy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers, they're effectively running factories on diesel generators. This is not an economy growing at 3% as claimed, it's an economy bleeding money to stay functional.\n\nPillar 2: They're back to defending the Naira\n\n|**2025 FX Intervention**|**Amount**|\n|:-|:-|\n|CBN dollars sold to defend naira|**$7.53 billion**|\n|YoY reserve increase|$4.62 billion|\n|Net position|**-$2.91 billion (burning reserves)**|\n|Current reserves|\\~$45 billion|\n\nThey're spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves. The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased, not earned. Inevitably these interventions will stop, either due to reserve depletion, election spending or an oil price shock (hello Venezuelan capacity!)\n\nPillar 3: The biggest smoking gun: Imputed Rent Scam\n\nReal Estate jumped from 6% to \\~11% of GDP in the 2025 rebasing, a massive portion of this is 'imputed rent' - the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves.\n\nFor context:\n\nEconomists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for. Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP. This is done in a lot of countries. So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it?\n\n1, They have no functional property registry to establish actual values.\n\n2, 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing\n\n3, Properties counted at \"market rent\" usually don't even have running water or electricity\n\n4, The valuation method is impossible to audit, and is infalsifiable\n\nThey're not measuring wealth that exists, they're measuring desperation, adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP.\n\nRent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage.\n\nPillar 4: The Sector Shell Game\n\nEvery Nigerian GDP rebasing \"discovers\" sectors that conveniently offset dying ones. The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction: up.\n\n|**Rebasing Year**|**GDP \"Explosion\"**|**\"Discovered\" Sector**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2014|**+89%**|Telecoms & Nollywood|\n|2025|**+35%**|Fintech & Real Estate|\n\nThe have never once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better.\n\nCountries around the world, including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing. Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure.\n\n2025 Sector Shift\n\n|**Sector**|**Old Share**|**New Share**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Industry/Manufacturing|27.7%|21.1% ↓|\n|Services (ICT/Trade)|50.2%|55.5% ↑|\n|Real Estate|6.2%|10.8% ↑|\n\nManufacturing collapses, gets relabeled to 'services', oil falls, gets offset by 'discovering' fintech. The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be.\n\nWith this thesis and Nigeria's own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data, I think the Naira, worthless as it is, is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct.\n\nI leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane, the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025.\n\nOn power: \"The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head. Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that.\"\n\nOn growth targets: \"If you are to get from $250 billion to $1 trillion in 5 years, it means the economy has to grow at 15%. But you are growing at 3%.\"\n\nOn real estate: \"Real estate will not generate dollars for you. Oil and gas will generate dollars.\"\n\nOn the trajectory: \"The economy is limping its way into recovery, not leaping.\"\n\nOn living standards: \"The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago.\"\n\nThis is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media, telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs, the growth targets are fantasy, and living standards have declined over 15 years. He's an insider, not a shortseller.\n\n  \nEdit: Adding the exit strategy\n\nNigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubu's term that he stole the last election from popular reformist, Peter Obi. He's confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before, an agrarian export-focused Nigeria with no currency protections. \n\nIf he wins, the protections are gone, the Naira tumbles. If he wins, but Tinubu steals it from him again, markets send the naira tumbling anyway.", "score": 1257, "num_comments": 348, "over_18": false, "author": "Jaded-Dot66"}

Companies with ICE exposure are now facing what analysts are calling a \"volatility factor\" - where reputational damage, employee dissent, and local legal resistance can materially impact valuations regardless of federal funding levels.\n\nPrivate prison operators GEO Group (GEO) and CoreCivic (CXW) carry the highest concentration risk, with GEO deriving roughly 40%+ of revenue from ICE-related operations. Despite benefiting from post-election enforcement expansion, both stocks have turned volatile as legal resistance intensifies in states like California and New Jersey, and municipalities increasingly use zoning laws to block new detention facilities.\n\nBig tech names including Palantir (PLTR) and Amazon (AMZN) face a different threat: internal resistance. Palantir has weathered repeated employee protests over its immigration software contracts, while Amazon's AWS infrastructure supporting DHS operations makes it a frequent target for boycott campaigns despite the revenue being financially immaterial.\n\nPerhaps most surprising is the hospitality sector's exposure. Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) face what the report calls \"brand contagion risk\" - where franchise-level decisions can quickly escalate into nationwide boycotts. Hilton is currently navigating pressure from both sides after a Minnesota Hampton Inn refused service to ICE personnel, triggering political backlash while still remaining exposed to activist scrutiny elsewhere.\n\nThis feels like a new paradigm where federal contracts don't automatically mean safe revenue anymore.", "score": 242, "num_comments": 54, "over_18": false, "author": "CoolioBeansTTV"}

Wanted to post my analysis for critique:\n\nFor context I have previously just held index funds (S&P 500 & FTSE 100) but with growing fears (believable IMO) of an AI/ Tech bubble and the fact that the S&P 500 is currently 34.43% weighted to Tech I wanted to look at diversifying away from that with some defensive stock picks.\n\nMy professional background is healthcare so seems a reasonable place to start.\n\nFirstly I would say the safe bet is that GLP-1 agonists and similar drugs are going to be a mainstay of pharamacetutical sales over the next 10 years and probably further into the future. They have shown themselves already to be a silver bullet for weight loss & obesity which is a plague of the western word. Furthermore there is good evidence to suggest they are powerful at reducing obesity related diseases with hard endpoints (morbidity and mortality) like diabetes and heart disease etc. On top of this they do this with what seems to be an acceptably rare side effect profile (notably there are cases of severe pancreatitis which is life threatening). I'm not sure if many would disagree with this first point.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as you probably know are the only two companies to have GLP-1 Receptor agonists on the market and both have other drugs in pipeline. Other key companies with drugs in pipeline include Roche, Amgen and Pfizer which aquired one with Metsera.\n\nThe horizon includes the oral version of Novo's existing drug semaglutide which just got FDA approval and a new small molecule drug from Lilly; Orforglipron which should be noted for the fact that it will probably be cheaper to produce than Novo's large molecule oral semaglutide. Lilly also has a triple agonist (retatrutide) which hits two other key receptors with a differing affinity profile which seemed to be quite effective based on their dose escalation phase II trials with phase III trials ongoing. Novo has a dual and a triple agonist also in the pipeline at Phase II.\n\nSo as alot of people have alluded to Novo's share price has plummeted from an all time high in the last year with the accepted narrative being that Lilly has eaten its lunch by being able to rapidly take market share through faster manufacturing with what seems to be a slighlty more effective drug (Tirzepatide / Mounjaro).\n\nI don't have a background in finance or stock analysis but I have tried to compare these GLP-1Ra related companies using key value investing ratios for the last financial year below. I have avoided using any forward looking metrics (like PEG or projected EPS) because in my inexperieced view that is just relying on someone elses prediction about what will happen and why would they know? I've just focused on whether the business is well run and has good fundamentals.\n\n|**Stock**|**Roche**|**Amgen**|**Pfizer**|**Eli Lilly**|**Novo Nordisk**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Price in USD**|$422.11|$340.55|$25.66|$1,107.89|$57.11|\n|**Current Price before conversion**|336.40|340.55|$25.66|1,107.89|365.25|\n|**Market Cap ($)**|342.2B|184.4B|146.5B|1055.0B|253.6B|\n|**P/E**|28.68|26.37|14.91|54.04|15.6|\n|**EPS**|11.75|12.94|1.72|20.45|23.33|\n|**EV/EBITDA**|13.02|13.53|7.83|34.29|10.10|\n|**Debt / Equity**|1.05|5.67|0.67|1.79|0.60|\n|**ROIC**|18.54%|10.56%|7.04%|29.95%|42.81%|\n\nNot only does Novo have a much better P/E ratio compared to competitors it also has higher earnings per share, better value to earnings ratio, better debt to equity ratio. Finally the return on invested capital is significantly higher and has been high for years. Essentially this business is highly efficient at turning invested capital into returns.\n\nSo this just means the business is well run and has good financials. But surely theres a risk that Eli Lilly will just dominate the market with better drugs? That is definetely a possibility, especially with the potentially cheaper Orforglipron, but I would argue the obesity market is so large and is likely to get even larger as developing countries become richer. So much so that there will be a large enough market for Novo to still sell plenty of their drugs even if they are number 2 behind Lilly, and hopefully derive growth and value over the long term. Essentially it doesn't need to be see as a 'winner takes all situation' with such a large market.\n\nThe problem with Lilly is the current price. Just compare those same metrics with a whopping PE of 54.04. It otherwise seems like a reasonably well run company with good prospects pipeline wise.\n\nAnd yes there are other risks for Novo, the standard pharma risks of drugs not working as intended, or intolerable side effects, but this isn't a new class of drugs so hopefully those risks are minimised.\n\nOn the plus side Novo does have other (smaller) facets to its business including insulin and rare disease medicines so this does slightly reduce the downside risk if they gut hammered in the GLP-1 Market.\n\nI will probably end up buying a bundle of 3 of these companies (including Lilly and maybe Roche) but weight it towards Novo.\n\nI'm not posting this all so you can agree with me, I'm hoping for (hopefully) insightful critiques.
