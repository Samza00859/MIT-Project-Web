Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets. This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the world's most elaborate coincidence. Further research needed.\n\n# Introduction\n\nI analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and S&P 500 performance between Dec. 2020 - Dec. 2025. The data suggests something unexpected: virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes. RS3 bond price movements consistently lead S&P 500 changes by approximately 49 days, suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets.\n\n# Methods\n\n**Data Processing Steps:**\n\n1. Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds (via WeirdGloop API) and S&P 500 (via quantmod)\n2. Inner join performed to ensure date alignment\n3. Returns calculated as percentage changes: r\\_t = (P\\_t / P\\_(t-1) - 1) × 100\n4. Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations\n5. Normalization performed using min-max scaling for visualization\n\n# Results\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* RS3 bond price movements consistently precede S&P 500 changes by 49 days (r = 0.428, p < 0.001)\n* Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022, suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature\n* RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the S&P 500 (daily SD: 2.35% vs 1.09%)\n* This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive early-warning system for broader economic sentiment shifts\n\n[Normalized 90-day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading S&P 500 movements by approximately49 days.](https://preview.redd.it/vmia3n0xoe8g1.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee9242eeea37aa932a08b33561c3288ed46484a)\n\n[Cross-correlation function revealing peak correlation at -49-day lag, indicating RS3 bonds leadS&P 500 by 49 days.](https://preview.redd.it/x4856r6yoe8g1.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd00e3fb8daceb6e5bc594294dfdd9502401c9f8)\n\n[30-day rolling volatility showing virtual economy as a more sensitive early-warning system.](https://preview.redd.it/6foap4xyoe8g1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aac479ccae9c01b2dc6d2a3e3f32b0b342b649c)\n\nThe rolling correlation analysis shows that this predictive relationship **strengthened significantly post-2022**, potentially due to growing integration of gaming into mainstream consumer behavior.\n\n[90-day rolling correlation showing strengthening predictive relationship over time.](https://preview.redd.it/3e6fvw70pe8g1.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=f800417493e5b68fc063c6dd8646326eb3d1aac6)\n\nBoth markets exhibit fat-tailed distributions, with RS3 bonds showing significantly wider tails. This amplification of sentiment signals, combined with the 49-day lead time, creates a potentially valuable early warning system.\n\n[Distribution of daily returns showing RS3’s fat-tailed nature as an amplified sentiment indicator.](https://preview.redd.it/t1asfpe1pe8g1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa761dfb4569a52e01a7fac95d6ee0140b4eb74d)\n\n# Trading Strategy\n\nBased on these trends, the report outlines specific signal rules for portfolio positioning using RS3 data:\n\n**BUY Signal (Increase S&P 500 Exposure):**\n\n* When: RS3 bond 30-day moving average increases by ≥3%\n* Action: Begin accumulating S&P 500 exposure starting 10-20 days after RS3 signal\n* Expected Outcome: S&P 500 likely to appreciate around Day 49\n* Success Rate: 63.3% (based on historical backtesting)\n\n**SELL Signal (Reduce S&P 500 Exposure):**\n\n* When: RS3 bond 30-day moving average decreases by ≥3%\n* Action: Begin reducing S&P 500 exposure starting 10-20 days after RS3 signal\n* Expected Outcome: S&P 500 likely to decline around Day 49\n* Success Rate: 39.1% (inverse - signals to avoid market)\n\n**HOLD Signal:**\n\n* When: RS3 bond moves less than ±3% over 30 days\n* Action: Maintain current allocation\n* Rationale: Insufficient signal strength\n\n# Software and Environment\n\n**Core Tools:**\n\n* R 4.3.0\n* R Markdown\n* XeLaTeX\n* Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding assistance\n\n**R Packages:**\n\n* quantmod\n* tidyverse\n* jsonlite\n* lubridate\n* zoo\n* ggplot2\n* gridExtra\n* httr\n* knitr\n* kableExtra\n* scales", "score": 5275, "num_comments": 444, "over_18": false, "author": "Traditional-Sink1537"}

Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.”\n\nThe ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThis compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November.\n\nThe ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares.\n\nMusk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock.\n\nIn 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded.\n\nMusk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies.\n\nTesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands.\n\nIn November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales.\n\nTesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan.\n\nThe Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.", "score": 400, "num_comments": 242, "over_18": false, "author": "Aluseda"}

Discovery's assets with those of Paramount Sky Dance (parent company of CBS News) would facilitate regulatory approval.\n\nA Paramount Pictures spokesperson has not yet responded to requests for comment.\n\nWhy Warner Bros. Discovery Favors Netflix\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery advised shareholders to reject Paramount Pictures' offer, stating its board believes the regulatory risks of both acquisition proposals are comparable. The company also indicated its analysis found Netflix's proposal which includes cash and Netflix stock to be more advantageous.\n\nThis has also raised concerns about the $40.65 billion equity investment in Paramount Sky Dance Media. Warner Bros. Discovery responded by stating, “The Ellison family has made no investment commitment of any kind.” According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person with a net worth of $243 billion.\n\nShortly before WarnerMedia made its proposal, Affinity Partners one of Paramount Sky Dance's financial backers announced its withdrawal from the hostile takeover bid. Affinity is a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAn Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that while the firm still believes Paramount Sky Dance's acquisition proposal holds “strong strategic merit,” it decided to withdraw due to “significant shifts in investment dynamics since our initial participation in October.”\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, the Warner Bros. Discovery board stated it views Netflix as having superior financial health, higher credit ratings, and greater market capitalization.\n\nThe letter stated: “Netflix's merger is fully backed by a publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion and an investment-grade balance sheet.”\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery added that Paramount Sky Dance's credit rating “is at or just one notch above ‘junk’ status with two major rating agencies,” while its market capitalization stands at $15 billion.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery also expressed concerns about Paramount's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its acquisition offer.\n\n“The trust's assets and liabilities would not be publicly disclosed and could change,” it wrote in its letter to shareholders. “As the name implies, revocable trusts typically contain provisions allowing assets to be transferred at any time.”\n\nAlthough Wednesday's shareholder letter indicated that Paramount's acquisition offer is not favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide whether to accept Paramount's bid for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery, and TNT.", "score": 204, "num_comments": 27, "over_18": false, "author": "Aluseda"}

Jared Kushner’s PE firm, Affinity Partners, has pulled its financing support from Paramount Skydance’s hostile bid. From what’s been reported, it was only about a $200M check in the grand scheme of things, but it still mattered. It wasn’t a big piece of the financing, but it was a politically connected name, and that backing is now gone. (News source, if you’re interested: [Netflix CEOs Defend WBD Buy, Pivot To Theaters.](https://www.moneyai-app.com/share/session?shareUuid=bf87e276-0fb9-4408-a192-da2a4daf64f3))\n\nNetflix already has an agreed deal to buy WBD at $27.75 per share, or roughly $72B. Paramount Skydance countered with a $30 per share all cash hostile offer aimed directly at shareholders. The reporting so far suggests WBD’s board is leaning toward sticking with Netflix rather than engaging with the hostile bid.\n\nWhat makes this situation feel unusual to me is that non financial factors are wrapped around the deal.\n\nParamount’s bid comes with big name backers, but it also brings political baggage. The CBS and Trump comments have pulled the deal into the public spotlight, which can slow the process down even if the headline price looks higher on paper.\n\nWBD’s Q3 2025 release showed about $9.0B in revenue, down excluding FX. The market has been watching whether improvements in streaming profitability can continue to offset the decline in linear networks, especially with the debt load still hanging over the company. That’s why Affinity walking away doesn’t really change how I read the situation. It hurts the optics of the hostile bid, but it doesn’t suddenly make the Netflix deal look worse, or make the underlying tradeoffs any simpler.", "score": 88, "num_comments": 22, "over_18": false, "author": "SuccessfulPie9317"}

If that breaks cleanly, the next likely stop is the mid $160s, around $165 to $160. Below that, you’re probably looking at the low $150s, and that usually needs a broader market wobble or a real shift in the AI narrative.

There were times I was too aggressive or too concentrated, and it hurt. Looking back, I wish I had focused more on building a portfolio that is steady over the long term but flexible enough to adapt when needed.\n\nCurious to hear from others.

Historically, the Sahm indicator has been used as a confirmation tool for \"recession\" (I use quotes because I feel the term has become more and more ambiguous in recent years) and is a measure of how unemployment is trending.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the Sahm indicator--It looks at the unemployment moving average.  Fundamentally, it takes a look at the lowest 3-month moving average over a 12-month period (currently about \\~4.2%) and compares it to the most recent 3-month moving average.  Essentially, if the current 3-month moving average is .50% (50 bps) higher than the 3-month moving average low, it produces a confirmation signal of \"recession\" with no historical false positives. \n\nThe current moving average of unemployment is \\~4.43% which puts us north of 20 bps toward the signal.  If the January 9th print is anything higher than 4.7%, there will be real concerns about the state of the economy (will put unemployment moving average at about \\~40 bps above  the moving average low).  As of today's (12/17) price action, it looks like the market is pricing in the possibility of an accelerating unemployment trend that could continue in January's print.  The Fed recently cut rates which may help reduce firing rates as cost saving measures, but January's unemployment print will be critical in understanding where the economy is at and likely where the stock market will go next.  \n\nTL;DR--If unemployment print on 1/9/26 >4.7%, risk off.  If less than, likely a neutral to risk on shift.", "score": 56, "num_comments": 26, "over_18": false, "author": "BigFuckingGainz"}
