It's useless for them.\n\nEdit: following a comment - it's not exactly useless, it also lets them know how much you have and are willing to invest to see if you're worth their time.\n\nThe only time they need it is when they finally advertise their pump and dump scam stock. They require the screenshots of the transactions so they can figure out how much money they scammed out of you to get a cut.\n\n  \n5. After 2 months regular stock recommendations. They will advertise and hype up their scam stock, promising 150% gains. They want you to put as much as possible.\n\nJust to add on, they don't specify the stock ticker until the last day (Dec 8). They advertise the releasement of the stock ticker, not the stock itself.\n\n6. [chow stock - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=chow+stock).

The narrative is always the same: the brokers claim they want to give us access to the same high returns that endowments and the ultra-wealthy have enjoyed for years.   \n\nBut I’ve been digging into the market data and I’m convinced this is fishy as fuck. It looks a lot less like an opportunity for us and a lot more like a desperate need for exit liquidity for the big players.\n\nInstitutional investors like pension funds and endowments are currently \"over-allocated\" to private markets. Because public stocks took a hit or stayed flat over the last couple of years while private valuations didn't mark down as fast, their portfolios are out of balance. They are effectively tapped out. They can't put more money in, and more importantly, they are screaming for cash distributions. They want their money back, but VCs and PE firms are struggling to give it to them because the IPO market is tepid and M&A is slow.  \n\nThis is where the retail investor comes in. Since the \"smart money\" is tapped out, Wall Street needs a new ocean of capital to keep the machine running. They need someone to buy the assets that the older funds need to sell.  \n\nYou can see this clearly in the AI sector. We all know valuations for AI startups like OpenAI are completely disconnected from reality, often trading at over 100 times revenue with little to no profit. Hedge funds and VCs who bought in during the 2021 hype or the recent AI boom are sitting on massive paper gains, but they having the problem, that if they would try to IPO these companies right now, the public markets might reject those valuations, forcing a \"down round\" that crushes their returns and makes them lose a shit ton of money.  \n\nThe solution is to avoid the public market entirely. Instead, they move these assets into \"continuation funds\" or sell them on the secondary market. And who is financing this? It’s retail capital. They are effectively moving assets from the pockets of savvy institutional investors who want out into the pockets of retail investors who are just getting in. The most dangerous part is how they structure it. They sell these as \"semi-liquid\" funds, but the liquidity is an illusion. \n\nThese funds have \"gates,\" meaning that if everyone panics and tries to sell at once, like in a recession, they simply lock the door. We saw this with Blackstone’s real estate fund recently.  \n\nSo you basically become the bag holder for assets that are too expensive for the public market to touch. \n\nJust know that when you hear about the \"democratization of finance\" be very careful. “Democratization” usually happens right at the end of a cycle when the insiders need someone to sell to, true to the motto: privatize earnings, socialize losses.", "score": 1943, "num_comments": 214, "over_18": false, "author": "eska089"}

Three members dissented the most since 2019. Governor Stephen Miran pushed for a larger half-point cut, while Kansas City’s Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago’s Austan Goolsbee argued for no cut at all. That split essentially captures the Fed’s current dilemma: one camp is growing more concerned about weakening labor data, while the other worries that easing too fast could reignite inflation. This is Miran’s third straight dissent ahead of his January departure, and Schmid’s second. The mixed messaging reinforces the idea that although cuts are happening, the path forward may be slower and bumpier than markets expected.

Businesses with <100 employees are exempt. This further delays large businesses seeking to downsize even after they finalize a plan.\n\n- Small businesses have less access to capital and higher borrowing costs to be able to ride out short to mid term impacts to cash flow, making layoffs necessary to manage cash flows when revenue falls. Larger companies have access to revolving credit facilities at low interest rates which addresses short term cash flows challenges.\n\nAs a result of all this, small businesses are actually a really strong leading indicator of where the labor market will go. Large businesses, while slower to react to business conditions, are historically even more cyclical than small businesses. So we are likely to see a reduction in employment at mid to large private sector firms in the near future.\n\nPosition: Lots of VGLT to bet on rate cuts and QE pushing up bond prices/yields down.

Ford, which had bet big on EVs, is now making one of the industry’s biggest changes to its business.\n\nThe company said it remains on track to produce a $30,000 EV pickup for sale by 2027, which the company says will be the first in a new string of low-cost EVs. “Now this is the core of our EV strategy in America,” Farley said. “We’ve got to land the plane.”\n\nThe company will stop making an EV version of its F-150 pickup truck, called the Lightning, and will instead make an extended-range version of the truck. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported company executives were discussing scrapping the EV version.\n\nFord said that by 2030 roughly half its global volume will consist of hybrids, extended-range vehicles and EVs, up from 17% this year. The shift to hybrids is accelerating around the world, as those vehicles are increasingly seen as more affordable and practical to consumers who are reluctant to commit to pure EVs.\n\nTo boost revenue, Ford will turn its Kentucky EV-battery factory into a battery-storage business for customers such as utilities, wind- and solar-power developers, and massive data centers that train artificial intelligence.\n\nRead More Here:\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ford-takes-19-5-billion-charge-to-write-down-ev-investments-333a9bc4?mod=hp\\_lead\\_pos1](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ford-takes-19-5-billion-charge-to-write-down-ev-investments-333a9bc4?mod=hp_lead_pos1)", "score": 418, "num_comments": 310, "over_18": false, "author": "_hiddenscout"}

He was one of the three members who voted against the quarter-point cut, and his reasoning essentially comes down to timing. In his view, the committee should have waited rather than moving ahead with another reduction. Goolsbee pointed out that he’s still optimistic about the broader trajectory particularly heading into 2026, where he believes rates can be “a fair bit lower” than they are now. But despite that longer-term confidence, he felt the current environment didn’t justify an immediate cut, especially while the Fed is still trying to balance easing financial conditions with keeping inflation on a durable path downward. His comments don’t necessarily change the broader outlook, but they do show how divided the committee has become.

Margin.\n\nIt started with slow, steady gains. I owned SOXL, GOOG, UNH, CNC, and I bought them all at lows in April. I made a killing, obviously. Lots of options got me there.\n\nI was on top of the world, invincible, could quit my job and become a trader. So, I sized up my positions and tapped into margin.\n\nDay 1: Lost 15k. Day 2: 10k more. Day 3: 12k more.\n\nSo I swapped some positions around, went heavier on 3 positions and sold my diversification.\n\nMargined in more on \"the dips\", this is in the AI Space. DGXX, IREN, CIFR.\n\nFast-forward 2 months and -100k later, I have finally sold the rest of my Leverage and withdrawn the last from my margin account. Now, mainly back to just my retirement and tax-free accounts.\n\nI also lost a family member 25k with my investing tips.\n\nI guess I just want everyone to remember to stay humble. I have definitely learned a few lessons. Trying to sleep at night now with all the red flashes in my head. Hope this helps some of you from making my mistakes.\n\nIts funny because I know better. I did this in 2020 and took a 4 year break. Finally though I was ready agian, and I made a killing!!!\n\nNow I need to face my mistakes.\n\nEdit: for those of you who provided good advice and wisdom.

Oracle is also going head to head with hyperscalers that already run at massive scale. That raises execution risk. The whole thing only works if OpenAI demand stays strong for years, not quarters. If AI spending cools off at all, Oracle feels it fast because the capex isn’t flexible.", "score": 159, "num_comments": 88, "over_18": false, "author": "TrueValueInsights"}

Discovery is preparing to advise its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance’s hostile takeover bid, with a formal recommendation expected as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount’s proposal valued Warner Bros. Discovery at roughly $108 billion in an all-cash offer, or about $30 per share, but board members have expressed concerns over the offer’s financing, structure and overall terms compared with other strategic options. The board appears inclined to recommend the company’s existing deal with Netflix which combines cash and stock and focuses on core studio and streaming assets as a more secure and valuable path forward for shareholders.\n\nThe market has reacted to the escalating deal drama, with Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock weakening as news of the planned rejection circulated. Investors are watching closely as Paramount’s bid backed in part by funding from equity and debt partners faces internal resistance, and as other players like Netflix remain in contention. \n\nAlso, Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners has reportedly exited the takeover battle, marking a shift in financing participation for the Paramount bid. Paramount still has time to revise or sweeten its offer before its tender deadline in early January, but Warner Bros. Discovery’s board seems poised to side with the alternative that they believe offers greater certainty and value for shareholders", "score": 99, "num_comments": 12, "over_18": false, "author": "MarketFlux"}
