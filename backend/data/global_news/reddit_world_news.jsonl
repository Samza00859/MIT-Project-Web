Discovery, agreeing to pay $72 billion for the Burbank-based Warner Bros. film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.\n\nThe two companies announced the blockbuster deal early Friday morning. The deal would give Netflix such beloved characters as Batman, Harry Potter and Fred Flintstone.\n\n“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a statement. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like ‘Casablanca’ and ‘Citizen Kane’ to modern favorites like ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Friends’ — with our culture-defining titles like ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ and ‘Squid Game,’ we’ll be able to do that even better.”\n\nNetflix’s cash and stock transaction is valued at about $27.75 per Warner Bros. Discovery shares. Netflix also agreed to take on more than $10 billion in Warner Bros. debt, pushing the deal’s value to $82.7 billion.\n\nThe breakthrough came late Thursday, soon after a deadline for deal sweeteners. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast had submitted bids earlier in the week as jockeying intensified for Hollywood’s biggest prize.\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-12-05/netflix-prevails-in-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-opponents", "score": 13667, "num_comments": 1780, "over_18": false, "author": "Icy-Motor-8519"}

Given that industry announcements suggest firms are planning up to 100 gigawatts of compute capacity, the total capital expenditure could reach around $8 trillion, which would require roughly $800 billion in profits just to cover interest.  \n\n\nKrishna also highlighted that AI hardware like GPUs depreciates quickly and often needs to be replaced roughly every five years, which further undermines long-term financial returns. He said he believes the likelihood of achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI) with current technology is between zero and one percent, making the massive infrastructure bets more speculative than certain. \n\nStill, Krishna acknowledged the potential of today’s AI tools to deliver significant enterprise productivity gains. He cautioned that while infrastructure-heavy “AGI-race” spending may not pay off, more modest, business-focused AI deployments could still be worthwhile.\n\n[Link to article](https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-ceo-big-tech-ai-capex-data-center-spending-2025-12)", "score": 2053, "num_comments": 270, "over_18": false, "author": "98Saman"}

China has roughly double what the US has, and you need absolutely massive amounts of power just to run chip fabs and AI datacenters. Then there's manufacturing. Yes, the US is still ahead on cutting edge chips, but let's be real, manufacturing is what China does better than anyone. They've been subsidizing their chip industry hard. Cheaper electricity, cheaper transport, the whole industrial ecosystem backing it up.\n\nInfrastructure is where it gets kind of embarrassing. Projects that take the US years to approve and build? China finishes in months. It's not even close.\n\nNow, the US does lead on frontier models, your GPTs and whatnot. But here's the thing people miss: China is dominating open source AI. And open source is what actually gets deployed at scale. It's what regular businesses and developers can grab and run with.\n\nThere's also a cultural gap. The Chinese public is broadly pro AI. Americans are scared of it. That matters because whoever applies the technology first wins, not whoever invents it. That's how industrial revolutions work.\n\nMeanwhile, US policy has basically walked away from the second largest AI market on the planet. And China isn't sitting around waiting. They're building their entire AI stack without American technology. Once that's done, they'll export it everywhere. Call it the AI Belt and Road.\n\nDon't sleep on Huawei either. They move fast and they're legitimately strong. Add in more engineers, more researchers, more patents, a massive population, and a tech ecosystem that's entirely self contained.\n\nJensen's point is simple: if the US doesn't stay in the game, we'll end up buying AI from China instead of selling it to them.", "score": 1716, "num_comments": 504, "over_18": false, "author": "Boring-Test5522"}

Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in.\n\nIn the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said.\n\nThere will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development.\n\nThe newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.\n\nSource: https://www.theverge.com/news/836212/openai-code-red-chatgpt", "score": 1391, "num_comments": 317, "over_18": false, "author": "Old-Competition3596"}

I’m in Texas, so the cops went all in. They arrested me, searched my house, took all my electronics and paperwork, and even towed both of my cars and ripped through them. The only “drugs” they found were legal CBD gummies and a couple of CBD drinks I bought from a shop by a college, and I had receipts for everything. Their own field test and then the lab both came back with no THC. I was never charged with anything.\n\nThey still tried to take my stuff using civil forfeiture, so I hired a lawyer and spent around 50k fighting it. That case is now over. All my property has been returned and there are no charges and no open criminal cases against me.\n\nDuring the investigation, one cop sent a generic “this person is under investigation” email to all my banks and to Robinhood. It was not a court order, not a levy, nothing that said “freeze this account.” All of my banks and credit card companies ignored it. Only Robinhood decided to lock my brokerage account. The account is around 160k, mostly in three big stocks I’ve held since the COVID crash.\n\nSince then, the police and the city attorney have put in writing that there is no hold, no lien, no legal freeze, and that they don’t plan to go after my Robinhood funds at all. They’ve looked at the original email and basically said Robinhood misread it and treated it like something it isn’t.\n\nRobinhood has kept the account frozen for more than 18 months now. Every time I contact support, I get the same copy-paste answer about “our team is reviewing this, we can’t give a timeline.” I’ve filed complaints with regulators. The lawyer who handled the forfeiture case has a hearing on the 15th where he’s going to ask a judge to officially say there was never any freeze or lien, but he doesn’t really know Robinhood/FINRA stuff and I don’t have money for a second lawyer. Meanwhile I’m sitting on credit card debt and money I owe family while my savings are locked.\n\nCan Robinhood legally keep my account frozen this long when there’s no court order, no lien, and no seizure according to the city attorney and police, or is this something I can realistically take to arbitration or court and expect to win?\n\nWhat legal steps, if any, actually exist to force them to act instead of just sending the same “under review” response? For the hearing on the 15th, I don’t even know what my lawyer should be asking the judge for beyond some kind of order clearly saying there was never any freeze or lien and nothing on the government side stopping Robinhood from releasing my funds. I’ve also wondered if it’s even possible for a judge to order the police or city to send some kind of “release” email when the police are saying there was never a freeze in the first place.\n\nIf I do end up in arbitration or a lawsuit, I’d like to know whether there’s any realistic chance of getting extra damages for how long this has gone on and the financial mess it’s caused, or if it usually just ends with the account finally being opened. And I’d really appreciate guidance on what type of lawyer actually handles this kind of Robinhood/FINRA situation and how to find one who knows what they’re doing.", "score": 1325, "num_comments": 331, "over_18": false, "author": "Legitimate-Post-418"}

The actual loose float available is only 10-15 million shares.\n\nTomorrow morning three big buyers are hitting a wall of zero supply:\n\n- Short interest is still ~12M shares. Many are facing a margin call at the open and must buy to cover.\n\n- MM were selling calls all week on the rumor. With the AH gap to $440, thousands of Dec 19 contracts just went Deep ITM.

They can't buy yet, so arb desks will be buying Monday to warehousefor them. \n\nThe level of greed is on mars right now because every trading desk is aware of the mechanics and liquidity crunch. Institutions are holding because they know indexes will pay whatever it takes on Dec 18. Buying demand far outweighs supply. \n\nIt’s hard to say how exactly this plays out, but this is stock is crazy and this event is extremely unique.

The tech doesn’t work. The economics don’t add up.\"  \n  \nNo. The tech works. The physics work. The economics work.  \nWhat doesn’t work anymore is the old power structure built on scarcity.\n\n# 1. Oil survives on scarcity. Clean energy survives on abundance.\n\nOil is valuable because it is limited.  \n  \nYou can control supply.  \nYou can restrict access.  \nYou can manipulate flows and influence pricing.  \n  \nThat model has fed entire dynasties, countries, and corporate empires for decades.  \n  \nClean energy is the opposite.  \n  \nYou cannot corner the sun.  \nYou cannot own the wind.  \nYou cannot put a fence around photons.  \n  \nAs you scale solar, wind, storage, and smarter grids, you move closer to something energy markets are not built to handle: practical abundance. When a resource moves toward abundance, long term prices tend to trend down and control shifts away from those who used scarcity as leverage.  \n  \nThat does not threaten the technology.  \nIt threatens the business model that ruled the last century.\n\n# 2. Old money versus new players\n\nThis is not a morality play. It is a capital structure problem.  \n  \nOil money has had decades to dig into governments, regulators, media, and financial systems.  \nNew clean energy companies are still building basic profitability and scale. They do not have the same lobbying power or political weight.  \n  \nSo when you see pressure on clean energy stocks, it is not just \"the market is disappointed.\" It is also the inertia of old capital defending its territory.  \n  \nOld money is not going to roll over because the physics improved.\n\n# 3. Why clean energy stocks all look the same on the chart\n\nPeople say:  \n\"If this sector is the future, why do all these charts look like trash?\"  \n  \nBecause the market is not just pricing tech. It is pricing resistance.  \n  \nThe closer we move toward widespread clean energy adoption, the more direct the threat to those who rely on controlled scarcity. That resistance does not target one company. It hits the entire sector.  \n  \nSo the charts move together.  \n  \nMass rerates up when optimism spikes.  \nThen mass punishment when pressure comes back in.  \nRinse, repeat.  \n  \nYou are not just watching fundamentals. You are watching a power struggle reflected in price action.\n\n# 4. The transition is inevitable, but not painless\n\nClean energy wins on the long timeline for one reason: it is better aligned with physics and long term economics.  \n  \nOnce the upfront buildout is done, a lot of the \"fuel\" is free.  \nSunlight does not send an invoice. Wind does not negotiate shipping rates.  \n  \nBut the speed of the transition is not decided only by engineers. It is decided by capital and policy.  \n  \nThat is why you can see:\n\n* The technology already working at scale in many regions\n* The costs already competitive or better\n* Yet the sector still trading like it is some failed experiment\n\nThere is a fight over how fast the old model gets dismantled.\n\n# 5. What this means for investors\n\nIf you look at clean energy names and only see “downtrend,” you are missing the bigger picture.  \n  \nYes, the sector is volatile.  \nYes, many companies will fail.  \nYes, a lot of garbage got funded along the way.  \n  \nBut at the structural level, you are dealing with a simple reality:\n\n* The old world is built on monetizing scarcity.\n* The new world is built on scaling abundance.\n\nThe economic winner is obvious over decades. The path there will not be smooth, especially when trillions in old capital are on the line.\n\nThis is not financial advice.  \nIt is a reminder that red charts do not automatically mean \"dead tech.\"  \n  \nSometimes they mean the future is colliding with people who have every reason to delay it.", "score": 361, "num_comments": 150, "over_18": false, "author": "GeorgeHWBushDied2Day"}

The last 20 years he withdrew between $15-25k a year to help cover expenses. \n\n\n\nHe’s always talked to me about investing and taught me maybe half of what I know. It helped set me on a really solid path, but I never actually knew how well he did and he never tracked it.

I’d argue he did much better than he likely would have with an advisor (after fees) or even just following the normal 80/20 recommendation. So I think his performance is good. However, I don’t think it was *great* and likely when risk adjusted significantly underperformed. \n\n\n\nCurious what others think as everyone here always says “well good luck maintaining that for 30 years” and I never see realistic posts of people’s 30 year return so I figured I’d share a real life example.", "score": 317, "num_comments": 72, "over_18": false, "author": "Historical_Air_8997"}

Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000: \n\n\"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we had the ultimate search engine, it would understand everything on the web; it would understand, um, you know, exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. And that's obviously artificial intelligence.\"[ Google Co-Founder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI (2000)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OT_Uj2z3Z0) \\- For those that don’t know, it was supposedly Larry Page’s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI.\n\n# Full-stack AI\n\nNow, imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation. Your first thought will probably be: Which should I pick? ChatGPT immediately comes to mind, but you want to do your research properly. Through your research, you find that Google's Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck, at least among American AI models. Plus, they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model. Perfect. Google seems like a good choice. Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity (especially if they improve).\n\nBut what about implementation? Google offers enterprise-ready API:s via Vertex with more features coming like auth, database and payments, Google Cloud for storage, and now even at location TPU:s that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible. Super. Suddenly, your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google, and along the way, you never touch an Nvidia product.\n\nBut before you make your final decision, you ask yourself: Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term, so I don’t get vendor-locked with an inferior offering?\n\nI’ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never want to bet against the man - and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way. I don’t imagine Nvidia is particularly - or really at all - threatened by Google in the short term, though Google's TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices, reducing profit margin. Apparently, OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it, according to[ Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1994468652716859394), worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia. Though what is actually important is not the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future.\n\n# AlphaEvolve\n\nI allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed[ AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/). The evolutionary AI system had, in secret, improved everything from the training of their AI models to Google's hardware, i.e., their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multi-billion dollar deal for them, with Meta considering the same. \n\nThe remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro, not even Gemini 2.5. Today, it’s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations, and in the future, it will use far more powerful models than that. Meaning that the better Google’s AI models get, the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google’s models and hardware. The cheaper and better Google’s hardware, the more powerful models can be built and run. The more powerful the models, the better the hardware. And so on.\n\nBetter AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia’s CUDA moat. One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code, causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA. But once AI models become sufficiently advanced, the programming difficulty may not be a concern, or Google and Gemini create some CUDA-variant of their own. Rumors also exist of them doing just that.\n\n# All in all\n\nThis means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business, it’s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia. If they do it often enough, AI labs will eventually wonder: can you build better AI models without Nvidia? This will be especially true if other AI-labs do it too:[ “resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs”](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/tpuv7-google-takes-a-swing-at-the).\n\nDoes this mean I think Nvidia is done for? Not at all, as I said, I've spent enough time studying Jensen that I'd never want to bet against him. After all, he is a man who roommated with a 17-year-old ex-con covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5-trillion-dollar man. Jensen has a ton of cards to play, and he’s already playing them perfectly.\n\nNvidia still has a hardware/hardware-software lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future. If they make a substantial compute leap, Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia’s AI lab, absorb one of the AI labs, or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race. He is securing long-term deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia. Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development. He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem. Nvidia will likely begin to offer full-stack solutions of its own. And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia, Google and AMD.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I hold a significant long position in Google (Alphabet). The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not constitute financial or investment advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.  \n  \n**TLDR;** Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term, though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin. But over the long term, Google’s full stack offerings - AI models/applications, cloud and TPUs - with AI model’s designed to improve AI models and hardware (AlphaEvolve) getting better, Google might even take a long term lead. Though, Jensen is playing Nvidia’s cards perfectly.", "score": 155, "num_comments": 42, "over_18": false, "author": "acoolrandomusername"}
