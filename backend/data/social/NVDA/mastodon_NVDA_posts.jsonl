I either quit Columbus at the end of this month on my own, or they retrench me at the end of January. If I do it on my own, I get pay for Jan and Feb, if they kick me out I only get Jan's pay and then I have to go through the struggle with the UIF. For none-South Africans on my timeline...UIF=UnemploymentInsureanceFund. Been through that process twice before, and it's a shlep to get it done. You get a little compensation for 6 months but it's not full salary, govt doesn't have that much money to pay full salaries on UIF, but they can pay suspended policemen for 7 years with full salary. Anyway. I am apparently too expensive for the company so I either quit on my own accord, or they throw me off. Well, I wasn't the one that said Dolphin ScreenReader should be bought in 2023 and that I needed a company pc, they decided that all on their own. I told them about #NVDA, and even sent them the stuff NVAccess sent me last year, but they didn't want to bite, and now I'm too expensive, after they had to pay for an upgrade to DolphinScreenReader, to get the Scan&Read function. I wanted to quit last year, but didn't...because it'd mean I'd have to get rid of too many things, including the birds in my aviaries. Ah well, such is life...Job security isn't a thing, especially when you're disabled and a company insists on using proprietory software instead of freely available open-source software that can do the exact same and even better than what the proprietory stuff can, and if it cannot, you can always get the technically minded to write an NVDA Addon for your needs...or you can search through all the addons in the store to find out if one doesn't already fulfil said needs.....Still, that's me done at Columbus. I give my notice on 26 Jan, or I let them throw me off at 31 Jan. I think the first option is better. It'll not let the UIF process go away, but it'll give feb's pay, to give me time to seek other employ in the meantime.", "url": "https://mastodon.africa/@Sozhami/115864370509780726", "id": "115864370568608310", "source": "mastodon#hashtag", "symbol": "NVDA"}

{"who": "Lanie", "when": "2026-01-04T05:30:39+00:00", "content": "I bought myself a new keyboard with Christmas money, and after just a day of using it, I'm honestly kind of stunned by how much of a difference it's making.\nI picked up a Keychron K10 Max from Amazon and got it yesterday, and I don't think I ever want to go back to a membrane keyboard again.\nFor context: before this, I was using a Logitech Ergo K860. It's a split, membrane keyboard that a lot of people like for ergonomics, and it did help in some ways — but for me, it was also limiting. My hands don't stay neatly parked in one position, and the enforced split often worked against how I naturally move. It also wasn't rechargeable, and the large built-in wrist rest (which I know some people love) mostly became a dirt-collecting obstacle that I had to work around.\nAnother big factor for me is that I often work from bed. That means my keyboard isn't sitting on a perfectly stable desk. It's on a tray, my lap, or bedding that shifts as I move.\nThe Logitech Ergo K860 is very light, which sounds nice on paper, but in practice it meant the keyboard was easy to knock around, slide out of position, or tilt unexpectedly. Combined with the split layout, that meant I was constantly re-orienting myself instead of just typing.\nThe Keychron, by contrast, is noticeably heavier — and that turns out to be a feature. It stays put. It doesn’t drift when my hands move. It feels planted in a way that reduces both physical effort and mental overhead. I don't have to think about where the keyboard is; I can just use it.\nFor a bed-based workflow, that stability matters more than I realized.\nWith chronic pain, hand fatigue, and accessibility needs, keyboards are not a neutral tool. They shape how long I can work, how accurately I can type, and how much energy I spend compensating instead of thinking.\nThis new keyboard feels solid, responsive, and predictable in a way I didn't realize I was missing. The keys register cleanly without requiring force, and the feedback is clear without being harsh. I'm not fighting the keyboard anymore. It's just doing what I ask.\nWhat surprised me even more is how much better the software side feels from an accessibility perspective. Keychron's Launcher and its use of QMK are far more usable for me than Logitech Options Plus ever was. Being able to work with something that’s web-based, text-oriented, and closer to open standards makes a huge difference as a screen reader user. I can reason about what the keyboard is doing instead of wrestling with a visually dense, mouse-centric interface.\nThat matters a lot. When your primary interface to the computer is the keyboard, both the hardware and the configuration tools need to cooperate with you.\nI know mechanical keyboards aren't new, but this is my first one, and I finally understand why people say they'll never go back. For me, this isn't about aesthetics or trends. It's about having a tool that respects my body and my access needs and lets me focus on the work itself.\nI'm really grateful I was able to get this, and I'm genuinely excited to keep dialing it in. Sometimes the right piece of hardware, paired with software that doesn’t fight you, doesn’t just improve comfort. It quietly expands what feels possible.\n#Accessibility #DisabledTech #AssistiveTechnology\n#ScreenReader #NVDA\n#MechanicalKeyboards #Keychron\n@accessibility @disability @spoonies @mastoblind", "url": "https://allovertheplace.ca/@RareBird15/115835184067887924", "id": "115835184264155206", "source": "mastodon#hashtag", "symbol": "NVDA"}

I am totally blind, and not only is Amazon's Rufus annoying, but it breaks accessibility with my screen reader, NVDA, and when it doesn't, it still causes trouble.  When I enter a search for a product and navigate by heading in order to see each one, it sometimes puts me in an edit field to ask Rufus a question, so that I have to get out of it and start again.  Every time I try to read the description of a product, it takes me to videos and I get stuck in another edit box.  I can easily get out of it, but then, I must go through all of the headings again, including some sort of summary, to find the product description.  Sometimes, it's hidden so that I must do a find command just to locate it.  When I want to read the reviews, there are all sorts of videos above them.  Amazon was much easier to use before this rubbish was added.  If I remember correctly, they used to have a more accessible version of their website.  Does that no longer exist?I saw advice for adding specific lines to UBlock Origin, but the extention itself is not fully accessible.  After I enter the various lines of code, there is no properly labelled \"apply\" or \"okay\" button.  Instead, at the top, I just hear \"button\" for times, with no description for any of them.  Below is the page where I found the code.  Someone also mentioned some sort of css file with Firefox, but that involved Github, which is another nightmare to use with screen readers.https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1ezd7u4/rufus_how_to_disable/\n#accessibility #AI #Amazon #ArtificialIntelligence #blind #blindness #FireFox #NVDA #Rufus #technology #UBlockOrigin #Windows", "url": "https://someplace.social/@dandylover1/115831222566573875", "id": "115831222768008842", "source": "mastodon#hashtag", "symbol": "NVDA"}

RIM may work with screen readers other than JAWS.*\n(Note: You will need to skip down several headings to find the beginning of the article)\nI can't comment on this from a business perspective.  But I do know that I have never been able to connect remotely to any of my computers, either from Windows to Windows or from Android or IOS to Windows, with any commercially made program for the purpose.  The only one that works for me is NVDA Remote, which works on all three platforms, with Windows and the NVDA screen reader being a requirement.  The limitation, however, is that I can't hear the sound on the controlled computer, nor can I transfer files between it and the controller.  Fortunately, I don't really need these features and am happy just being able to control my machines at all.  But for those who do need them, RIM allows this, but only for users of JAWS (which costs several hundred dollars/NVDA is free), and the last time I checked, it is also very expensive for an individual user who doesn't require it for work purposes.  I'm also not sure if it is cross-platform, so it may only work with Windows.

First, NVDA doesn't come with all of the #Python standard libraries. Second, there's no good way of updating dependencies in a bundled addon. Third, NVDA really, really hates it if you include several hundred dependencies in your addon. Anyway, here's kitten TTS, the other synthesizer I wanted to try with NVDA. Unfortunately, the model doesn't support streaming output, so even though it's actually faster than Supertonic, it feels slower when used with NVDA. Also, it takes several minutes to install, makes NVDA startup 30 seconds slower, and freezes the change synthesizer dialogue for about 45 seconds when you open it. It does miss words less frequently, though, and pronounces text better. The ultimate result of my two-day investigation is that even the highly optimized open-source AI imbedded models are not yet ready for screen reader use. Some tree-shaking could fix some of these issues, but it still won't allow for streaming, so it's not worth it.

But since it's a seven-inch Toughpad, I wanted to try it with my Orbit Writer, due to the size.  I bought it to use with my iPhone, which it does very well (better than with Android,).  I read the manual and even saved the HID keyboard commands so that I could refer to them quickly.  But I don't understand a few things.1.  It is missing the Windows key.  Due to this, I can't get to the start menu as I usually do.  I also can't get to the desktop in the regular way.\n2.  I created a desktop shortcut which I put on the start menu, but I can't type ctrl+escape at the same time, so that method of getting to the start menu is also blocked, meaning that I still can't get to the desktop.\n3.  I can't type NVDA+F11 or F12 for the system tray or the time and date, respectively.  I was able to create new commands for both under Input Gestures.  But I also tried NVDA+1 for key identification, with both caps lock and insert, and that didn't work either.  Fortunately, I was able to create another gesture to get into the NVDA menu.\n4.  On a qwerty keyboard, I can type alt+f4 to switch between windows.  If I hold the alt key, I can also continue pressing f4 to switch between more than two windows.  But with the Orbit Writer, while the command works, it seems to only work for two windows i.e. I can't hold alt and continue pressing f4.Am I missing something here or is this a half-implemented system?  How can they say it works with Windows when basic commands can't even be performed?

I was using TweeseCake at the time.  No matter whom I asked or what I did, I couldn't figure out how to unmute it.  This only affected TweeseCake, and only when using the built-in speaker, as it worked fine with my Skull Candy Ounce.  The other day, on a whim, I began researching it again and I found the answer.  Apparently, Windows 11 has a feature that allows users to mute sounds in specific programs.  They can be unmuted by typing \"volume\" in the search box in the start menu, then tabbing to \"apps\".  There, you will see a list of all the programs that are running.  Arrow down to the one you want, and then hit tab.  There, you should see a mute or unmute button, depending on your current setting.  I still haven't found the shortcut that I pressed to start this mess, but at least I now know how to fix it.

I also want to switch back and forth between the two machines, as well as to and from the laptop itself, with a keystroke. There are two solutions I've found for this, but both are a bit of a mess. I can use thenvdaremote://  URLs to disconnect from desktop1 and connect to desktop2 with one keystroke, and have another keystroke to do the reverse. The problem there is that I can't hear both machines' NVDA at  the same time. Also, and this isn't as big a deal, I'm just a perfectionist, switching takes a few seconds. Secondly, I can run a virtual machine and have that connected to desktop2, with the host machine connected to desktop1. That allows easy switching of the keyboard,  just alt+tab to the VM window and hit ctrl+g when I want to control desktop2. It also allows both desktops to have their NVDA run through the speaker at the same time and also, which is very nice, allows braille to swap with any display which supports channels. The problem there is the latency of the VM audio, which I  can't seem to shrink. It seems a bit overkill, I may say, to run an entire windows OS just for NVDA remote in a VM. Does anyone have any better solutions. Can anyone think of something which would get all three things running, fast switching, simultaneous NVDA, and no latency? Ideas would be very gratefully received and boosts would be appreciated. #NVDA #blind #a11y #screenreader #remote #nvdaremote", "url": "https://tweesecake.social/@techsinger/115606510843063710", "id": "115606510873696749", "source": "mastodon#hashtag", "symbol": "NVDA"}
