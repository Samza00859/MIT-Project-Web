        "The Price to Earnings Ratio of 36.78 represents a significant premium valuation that may not be sustainable if growth expectations are not met or if market conditions deteriorate.",
        "Apple carries a high debt to equity ratio of 3.87, indicating substantial leverage that could pose risks during economic downturns or rising interest rate environments.",
        "The company operates in the highly competitive consumer electronics sector where technological obsolescence and rapid innovation cycles create constant pressure to maintain market leadership.",
        "Revenue growth data is not available in the current dataset, making it difficult to assess the company's growth trajectory and sustainability of current valuation multiples.",
        "Dependence on a limited number of product categories, particularly iPhone sales, creates concentration risk that could impact financial performance if demand for flagship products declines."
