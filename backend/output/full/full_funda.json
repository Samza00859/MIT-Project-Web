    "key_risks_analysis": [
        "Lack of Valuation Multiples: The absence of key valuation metrics such as Price to Earnings Ratio and Revenue Growth Year Over Year prevents a definitive assessment of current market valuation and recent growth trends.",
        "Moderate Leverage: While the Debt to Equity Ratio of 0.69 is not excessively high, it indicates a notable reliance on debt financing which could increase financial risk in a rising interest rate environment or during economic downturns.",
        "Missing Return on Equity Data: The inability to calculate Return on Equity means a key measure of how effectively the company generates profits from shareholder investments is unavailable, hindering a complete performance assessment.",
        "Capital Expenditures Data Missing: The absence of specific capital expenditure figures makes it challenging to fully assess the company's investment strategy and its impact on future growth and free cash flow generation."
