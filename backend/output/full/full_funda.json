    "executive_summary": "Amazon.com Inc is a global e-commerce and technology giant with a dominant market position. The company has demonstrated robust revenue growth over the past decade, expanding from $135.99 billion in 2016 to $637.96 billion in 2024, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 21.4%. However, profitability has been volatile, with a significant net loss in 2022 followed by a strong recovery to $59.25 billion in net income in 2024. The company maintains a substantial market capitalization of over $2.6 trillion, supported by its diverse ecosystem spanning retail, cloud computing (AWS), and digital streaming. Financial health appears strong, with significant cash generation from operations and a manageable debt profile relative to its equity base, though capital intensity remains high due to continuous investments in infrastructure and technology.",
