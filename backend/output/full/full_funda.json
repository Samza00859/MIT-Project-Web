    ],
    "key_risks_analysis": [
        "High financial leverage as indicated by a debt to equity ratio of 5.85, which is typical for banks but signifies a balance sheet heavily reliant on liabilities, increasing sensitivity to interest rate changes and credit risk.",
        "Moderate return on equity of 7.69 percent, which may be considered low for the banking sector, suggesting potential inefficiency in generating profits from shareholder capital.",
        "Critical valuation metrics such as the Price to Earnings ratio and Earnings Per Share are unavailable, preventing a clear assessment of whether the stock is trading at a reasonable market price.",
        "Lack of revenue growth data makes it impossible to evaluate the company's top-line expansion trajectory and competitive momentum in its operating market."
