        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies strong technical support (price above key MAs, VWMA) and the fundamental bullish driver of AWS margin expansion and backlog. However, it underweights the intelligence reports' clear signals of short-term momentum waning (declining MACD histogram, RSI retreat from overbought, price failing at resistance) and the mixed-to-neutral sentiment and news backdrop (regulatory fines, supplier price renegotiations, no dominant bullish narrative). The plan's urgency for a breakout is not fully supported by the current consolidation phase."

    "final_decision_signal": "HOLD",
    "trader_commentary": "The bullish long-term thesis for AMZN remains intact, but current technicals and sentiment do not justify an urgent BUY. The stock is in a healthy pullback/consolidation within a bullish trend. Await a clearer signal: either a confirmed hold above the 10-day EMA/VWMA support with renewed momentum (RSI/MACD turning up), or a decisive break above the 246.29 resistance. Monitor AWS news and regulatory developments closely. Risk is elevated for new long entries until this consolidation resolves."
