        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies NVDA's exceptional fundamentals and long-term AI dominance as core strengths. However, it underweights significant near-term headwinds validated by raw intelligence: technicals are bearish (price below key MAs, bearish MACD, selling pressure on volume), sentiment is cautious with mixed narratives, and news highlights intensifying competition (MetaX IPO, Rivian), political/regulatory risks (Warren, China), and a major accounting risk flagged by Chanos. The plan's view of the pullback as a 'strategic entry point' is reasonable given the 200 SMA support, but the intelligence suggests higher immediate risk of a breakdown below $174.67 support before a sustained reversal."

    "final_decision_signal": "HOLD",
    "trader_commentary": "Fundamentals are stellar, but the confluence of bearish technicals, negative competitive/news catalysts, and cautious sentiment creates excessive near-term execution risk for a new BUY. The stock is in a confirmed downtrend on all short-to-medium timeframes. Await either a technical reversal signal (e.g., reclaiming 10 EMA/50 SMA with volume) or a stabilization of the negative news flow before committing capital. Monitor the $174.67 Bollinger lower band closely; a breakdown would invalidate the buy thesis and target the 200 SMA ($156.63)."
