        "validation_notes": "The proposed SELL decision is strongly supported by the raw intelligence. Technical indicators are overwhelmingly bearish, with the price below key moving averages (50-SMA, 10-EMA, VWMA) and a negative MACD. The RSI is below 50, and the price is below the middle Bollinger Band, all pointing to short-term weakness. Price action summary confirms the downtrend and proximity to support levels. News reports highlight an approaching 'death cross' and mixed analyst sentiment, reinforcing the bearish technical outlook. Fundamentals are a major concern, with persistent net losses, negative and deteriorating free cash flow, and high debt levels, despite strong revenue growth. The proposed plan correctly identifies these as unacceptable risks and the primary drivers for a sell decision."

    "trader_commentary": "The technical and fundamental picture for NIO is unequivocally bearish. The proposed plan correctly identifies the critical financial distress and technical weakness. Execute SELL order immediately to mitigate further capital loss. Monitor for any significant positive fundamental shifts or sustained price action breaking key resistance levels, though this is unlikely in the short to medium term."
