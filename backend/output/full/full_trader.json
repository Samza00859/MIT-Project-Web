        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies the bullish technical setup (price above key MAs, positive MACDh) and the significant China catalyst (H200 exports). However, the raw intelligence shows the price ($189.21) is already at the Bollinger Upper Band ($188.76) resistance, not just approaching it, and the RSI (57.62) is neutral, not overbought. The plan's proposed entry at $180 is a 5% pullback to the 10 EMA/VWMA, which is plausible but not guaranteed given the strong momentum and positive news flow. The fundamentals confirm exceptional strength but also an 'Overvalued' status (P/E 44.8), supporting the plan's identified valuation risk."

    "trader_commentary": "Execute a scaled entry. Initiate a starter position now to capture the confirmed bullish momentum and imminent China catalyst. Allocate the majority of the intended capital for a pullback to the $182-$185 support zone (confluence of 50 SMA and rising VWMA). Do not chase the price above $190. The primary risk is a failed breakout at resistance leading to consolidation; the strong fundamentals and catalyst provide a buffer. Monitor for any negative shift in the China export timeline or a breakdown below the 10 EMA ($180.99) for stop-loss consideration."
