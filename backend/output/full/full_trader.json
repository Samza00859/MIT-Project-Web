        "validation_notes": "The proposed SELL decision is strongly supported by the raw intelligence. All key technical indicators (50-SMA, 10-EMA, MACD, VWMA) point to a bearish trend. The price trading near the lower Bollinger Band, coupled with negative MACD histogram and bearish market overview, confirms significant selling pressure. While fundamentals are strong long-term, current technicals indicate immediate downside risk, making a SELL call appropriate for downside protection. The mention of substantial inventory levels as a risk if demand falters further is also a valid point to consider in a bearish environment."

    "trader_commentary": "Execute SELL order immediately. Prioritize capital preservation given the overwhelming bearish technical signals. Monitor for potential breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band and the impact on inventory levels if demand weakens. The current market sentiment and technicals indicate further downside is likely."
