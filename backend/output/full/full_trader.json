        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies key technical risks: negative MACD histogram, proximity to Bollinger upper band, and potential for a near-term pullback. However, it overemphasizes these as a definitive SELL signal. Raw intelligence shows a strong bullish trend with price above all major SMAs, neutral RSI (61.9), and overwhelmingly positive market sentiment driven by a historic breakout and AI infrastructure narrative. The 'momentum deceleration' is a warning within a primary uptrend, not a reversal signal. The plan's conclusion is too bearish relative to the broader bullish evidence."

    "memory_application": "No specific past reflections were provided. Applying general trading wisdom: 'The trend is your friend.' Major breakouts to new all-time highs after a long consolidation (25 years) are significant and often lead to extended runs, not immediate reversals. Technical divergences should be respected but not acted upon in isolation against a strong primary trend.",
    "final_decision_signal": "HOLD",
    "trader_commentary": "Decision: HOLD. While a tactical pullback is likely, the primary trend is strongly bullish. A SELL here risks being whipsawed out of a major breakout. A more prudent approach is to hold existing positions with a stop-loss below key support (e.g., $74.89 - Bollinger middle / recent consolidation). For new money, await a better entry point on a pullback towards the 50 SMA ($71.46), but do not initiate a short. Monitor the MACD for a bullish crossover resumption."
