        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies technical weakness (negative MACD histogram, RSI decline) and fundamental risks (high leverage, low ROE). However, it overstates the case for immediate selling. Raw intelligence shows the primary long-term trend remains strongly bullish (price above 50 & 200 SMA), and the key macro driver (strong Baht attracting foreign inflows) is currently active and positive. The technicals indicate consolidation, not breakdown, with price still above key support and the VWMA. The 'Neutral' sentiment and news outlook do not support an urgent SELL."

    "memory_application": "No relevant past reflections were found, reinforcing the need for a disciplined, data-driven decision based solely on the current intelligence mix.",
    "final_decision_signal": "HOLD",
    "trader_commentary": "Decision: HOLD. The dominant bullish trend and supportive macro flow (strong Baht inflows) argue against a SELL. However, the weakening momentum and fundamental risks invalidate a BUY. Maintain position but monitor the 190.5 support level closely. A decisive break below this level on elevated volume, coupled with a reversal in the Baht's strength, would trigger a re-evaluation to SELL."
