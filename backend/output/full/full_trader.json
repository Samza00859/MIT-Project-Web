        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies the bullish long-term fundamentals (strong profitability, AWS AI potential) and the near-term technical resistance at ~247.38, supported by the MACD histogram decline and recent bearish candle. It also accurately notes regulatory and valuation risks from the raw reports. However, the plan's verdict is 'HOLD' with an entry strategy contingent on a pullback to 234 or a breakout above 247.38. The raw intelligence supports the cautious stance but shows the current price (242.60) is above key supports (10-day EMA, 50-day SMA, VWMA) within a bullish trend. A strict HOLD for an existing position is valid, but the data does not strongly support waiting for a pullback to 234 as the only entry condition, given the bullish structure. The neutral sentiment and mixed news flow align with a tactical pause, not a directional bias."

    "trader_commentary": "Maintain existing position. The technical setup shows a healthy consolidation within an uptrend, not a breakdown. Fundamentals remain robust. Await either a resolution above the 247.38 resistance for a momentum BUY signal or a deeper, high-volume washout towards the 50-day SMA (~234) for a value BUY opportunity. The current level offers no compelling edge for new capital. Monitor news flow for regulatory escalations or competitive shifts that could alter the risk/reward."
