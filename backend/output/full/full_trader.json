        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies the intact long-term bullish trend (price above 200 SMA) and the strong support confluence near $268. It also accurately highlights the positive fundamental catalysts (AI, price target upgrade, buybacks). However, the plan underweights significant near-term technical deterioration: price is below the 10 EMA and 50 SMA, MACD shows a bearish crossover with declining histogram, and VWMA indicates institutional selling. The 'urgent' execution call ignores that momentum is still weakening and RSI is not yet oversold, suggesting the pullback may not be complete."

    "trader_commentary": "Long-term thesis remains valid, but entry timing is premature. Technicals show momentum is still deteriorating. Await a confirmed stabilization or bounce from the $268 support zone, or a turn in short-term indicators (e.g., MACD histogram flattening, price reclaiming 10 EMA), before initiating a BUY. A breakdown below $268 would shift outlook to SELL."
