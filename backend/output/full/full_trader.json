        "validation_notes": "The proposed SELL decision is strongly supported by the raw intelligence. Market technicals show bearish momentum (MACD, RSI below 50), price below key moving averages (10-EMA, VWMA), and sideways consolidation with decreasing volume. Sentiment is bearish, with dominant narratives around valuation concerns and Elon Musk's influence. News highlights analyst doubts on valuation despite declining sales, and competition. Fundamentals confirm an extremely high P/E ratio (302.9), suggesting overvaluation, alongside volatile free cash flow and intensifying competition. These factors align with the plan's reasoning for an immediate exit."
