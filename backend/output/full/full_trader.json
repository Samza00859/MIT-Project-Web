        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies strong fundamentals and a dominant market position. However, it dismisses near-term geopolitical risks as 'noise.' Raw intelligence shows an immediate, tangible negative: Chinese customs are actively blocking approved H200 shipments, halting production and creating direct revenue uncertainty. Technicals are neutral, showing consolidation with fading momentum (negative MACD histogram), not a 'stable base.' Sentiment is neutral, not bullish. The plan's bullish thesis relies on a breakout above 193, which is not yet confirmed, and downplays significant execution risks."

    "final_decision_signal": "HOLD",
    "trader_commentary": "Fundamentals are stellar, but the stock is in a high-risk holding pattern. The China shipment blockade is a concrete, near-term operational headwind, not just noise. Technicals show indecision, not accumulation. A HOLD is prudent until we see either: 1) A decisive technical breakout above 193 resistance with volume, confirming the bullish case, or 2) Clarity on the China H200 situation and its financial impact. Do not buy into consolidation with negative news flow. Risk is elevated."
