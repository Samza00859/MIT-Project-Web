        "agreement_status": "Agree",
        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies the confluence of technical deterioration (confirmed MACD bearish crossover, price below 10 EMA and VWMA, testing Bollinger lower band) and fundamental overvaluation (P/E of 36.62). Raw intelligence confirms these risks: technicals show 'Bearish' sentiment and momentum shift; news highlights escalating regulatory fines and forced platform changes; fundamentals confirm 'Overvalued' status. The plan's SELL verdict is validated by the data."
    },
    "memory_application": "No specific past reflections were provided. Applying general trading principle: when technical breakdown coincides with fundamental overvaluation and negative catalysts, the risk/reward favors reducing exposure to avoid accelerated declines.",
    "final_decision_signal": "SELL",
    "trader_commentary": "Execute sell order. Key risk is a swift breakdown below $269 support, targeting next support at $266.25. Monitor for any positive news on AI developments in early 2026 that could provide a counter-trend rally, but current technical and fundamental setup justifies immediate risk reduction."
