        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies the long-term bullish structure (price > 200 SMA) and strong aggregate fundamentals. However, it downplays significant contrary signals from raw intelligence: technicals show a bearish MACD crossover, price below 10 EMA and VWMA, and declining RSI; sentiment is explicitly 'Bearish' with recession fears; news highlights rising unemployment and a hawkish Fed outlook for 2026. The plan's 'urgent buy' call on a dip conflicts with the intelligence suggesting a momentum shift and consolidation with downside risk to the 50 SMA."

    "memory_application": "No relevant past memories found.",
    "final_decision_signal": "HOLD",
    "trader_commentary": "The long-term trend remains up, but short-term momentum is deteriorating amid negative sentiment and macro headwinds. The price is in a consolidation phase below key short-term averages. A HOLD is prudent to await either a confirmed bounce from the 50 SMA support ($674.79) for a BUY signal, or a decisive break below it for a SELL signal. Do not chase the dip here; risk/reward is not favorable for immediate entry."
