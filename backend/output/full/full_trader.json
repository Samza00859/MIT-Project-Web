        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies key strengths (FCF, ROE) and catalysts (AI, analyst upgrades). However, it underweights significant risks: technicals show price below VWMA and 10 EMA indicating distribution and short-term weakness; fundamentals highlight extreme overvaluation (P/E 36.62) and high leverage (D/E 3.87); news includes material regulatory fines and pressure. The plan's urgency to buy 'urgently on this pullback' is not fully supported by the intelligence, which suggests a consolidation phase testing critical support."

    "memory_application": "No specific past reflections were provided. Applying general trading principle: 'Do not chase a stock into support during weakening momentum; wait for the support level to hold and for momentum to confirm a reversal.'",
    "final_decision_signal": "HOLD",
    "trader_commentary": "The long-term thesis for AAPL remains intact, but current intelligence does not support an urgent BUY. Technicals show the stock is in a corrective phase, testing key support at ~$269.64. A break below this level could lead to a deeper pullback. Fundamentals are rich, and regulatory headwinds are material. Await a confirmed bounce from support with improving momentum (e.g., RSI > 50, MACDh turning positive) or a more attractive valuation entry before initiating a position. Monitor the $269.64-$266.25 support zone closely."
