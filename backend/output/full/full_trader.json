        "agreement_status": "Agree",
        "validation_notes": "Raw intelligence confirms technical weakness (negative MACD histogram, consolidation near middle Bollinger Band, failure at ~189 resistance) and elevated near-term risks (China export uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, high valuation). The plan correctly identifies these as catalysts for a SELL, aligning with the neutral-to-cautious outlook from technicals and sentiment."
    },
    "memory_application": "No specific past reflections provided. Applying general trading principle: when strong long-term fundamentals are overshadowed by clear technical deterioration and acute near-term headwinds, it is prudent to reduce risk and await a more favorable technical setup or risk resolution.",
    "final_decision_signal": "SELL",
    "trader_commentary": "Execute sell order with urgency. Price action shows distribution, not accumulation. Key risk is a break below 184.55 support, which would accelerate selling. Re-enter only on a confirmed reclaim of 189 resistance with improving momentum, or a washout to stronger support (~178) coupled with positive resolution on China risks."
