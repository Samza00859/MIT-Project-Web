        "validation_notes": "The plan correctly identifies strong fundamentals (125% YoY revenue growth, 55.8% net margin) and positive catalysts (China H200 demand, strategic acquisitions). However, it underweights the technical and sentiment risks. Raw intelligence shows a clear 'Bearish' market technicals label, with price below key SMAs, negative MACD, and volume-weighted selling pressure. Sentiment is 'Neutral' with valuation concerns, and the stock is not yet oversold (RSI 41.61). The plan's proposed stop-loss at the 200-SMA ($156.32) is too distant (~11.5% below current price), ignoring nearer critical support at the Bollinger Lower Band (~$174.80)."

    "trader_commentary": "Fundamentals and news are strong, but current technicals show accelerating bearish momentum and lack a clear reversal signal. The risk/reward for an immediate BUY is poor; price is likely to test the $174.80 support. Await either a confirmed bullish reversal (e.g., break above 10-EMA with volume) or a deeper oversold condition (RSI < 30) before initiating a long position. Monitor for a break below $174.80, which would invalidate the near-term support thesis."
