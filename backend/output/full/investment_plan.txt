BUY. The most compelling evidence supports a long-term bullish outlook centered on Apple's intact primary uptrend and imminent growth catalysts, outweighing near-term technical concerns. The stock remains decisively above its 200-day Simple Moving Average, confirming a steadfast uptrend, and the current pullback to a strong support confluence at the 50-day Simple Moving Average and Bollinger Lower Band near two hundred sixty eight dollars presents a high-probability entry point for investors. Fundamentally, the alignment of a major iPhone cycle with transformative artificial intelligence integration via Siri 2.0, as highlighted by Morgan Stanley's raised price target, provides a clear growth narrative for 2026, while the company's massive free cash flow and share repurchases offer underlying price support. Execution should be urgent to capitalize on this dip, with an initial entry at current levels and a stop loss below the two hundred sixty eight dollar support to manage risk. The critical risk to monitor is a sustained breakdown below the two hundred sixty eight dollar support zone, which would invalidate the bullish structure and necessitate a reassessment, but the weight of evidence points to resilience and upward momentum as artificial intelligence initiatives mature.
