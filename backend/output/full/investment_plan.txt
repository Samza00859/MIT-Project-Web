Verdict: BUY. The most compelling evidence supporting a buy decision is the robust long-term technical foundation with the stock firmly above its 200-day Simple Moving Average, indicating the primary uptrend remains intact, coupled with extraordinary fundamental strength demonstrated by 125 percent year-over-year revenue growth and 55.8 percent net margins, which justify the current valuation. Immediate catalysts such as surging demand from China for H200 artificial intelligence chips and strategic software ecosystem expansions provide near-term revenue momentum, while the technical pullback to the Bollinger Lower Band with the Relative Strength Index approaching oversold levels offers an attractive risk-reward entry point. The execution strategy is to initiate or add to positions urgently at current levels, targeting a move above the 50-day Simple Moving Average resistance, with the 200-day Simple Moving Average at 156.32 dollars serving as a strict stop-loss level. The critical risk to monitor is the potential for a valuation compression should the artificial intelligence capital expenditure cycle moderate or competition intensify, threatening the high Price to Earnings ratio assumption.
