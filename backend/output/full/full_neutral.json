    "judge_decision": "{\n    \"recommendation\": \"BUY\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The Risky Analyst correctly emphasizes Nvidia's 'historic' financials and the 'temporary, solvable speed bump' of the China H200 blockade, while the Safe Analyst provides a necessary caution regarding the 'direct, state-mandated blockade' and technical risks (negative MACD, key resistance). The Neutral Analyst's 'strategic compromise' best synthesizes these views, advocating for a risk-adjusted approach that avoids the paralysis of excessive caution and the recklessness of ignoring immediate headwinds. Past trading mistakes underscore the danger of either full paralysis or unhedged aggression in the face of uncertainty. Therefore, the decision is to buy, but with a disciplined, phased plan that respects both the long-term thesis and near-term risks.\",\n    \"refined_trader_plan\": \"Initiate a reduced core position (25-33% of intended full allocation) at current levels between 178 and 193. Place a hard stop loss at 177.70 (below the 178.70 key support) to limit downside. Defer the majority of capital (67-75%) until a decisive daily close above the 193.29 resistance level, confirming that the market has discounted the near-term geopolitical overhang. This staged entry maintains exposure to Nvidia's AI dominance while strictly managing the immediate operational and technical risks identified in the debate.\"\n}",
    "history": "\nRisky Analyst: The Conservative and Neutral analysts are paralyzed by short-term noise, mistaking a temporary geopolitical friction for a structural threat. Yes, Chinese customs are blocking H200 shipments, but this is a minor, solvable speed bump against a backdrop of epoch-defining financial performance. Nvidia’s fundamentals are not just strong; they are historic, with revenue surging to $130.5 billion and a net profit margin of 56%. This company is printing cash from the AI revolution, and a brief logistical hiccup does not derail a $1 trillion growth runway. The technical consolidation they fear is not weakness; it is the coiled spring before the next leg up, offering a prime entry point before the breakout. Fortune favors the bold: buy this dip aggressively, leverage the volatility, and own the undisputed king of artificial intelligence.\nSafe Analyst: The Risky Analyst's dismissal of concrete operational headwinds as \"noise\" is precisely how capital is destroyed. This is not a minor speed bump; it is a direct, state-mandated blockade of a critical revenue channel, halting production and creating immediate financial uncertainty amidst escalating global trade wars. The technical picture confirms the danger: price is trapped in consolidation with a negative MACD histogram, signaling fading momentum, and faces stiff resistance at 193.29. The worst-case scenario is a cascade: the China disruption triggers a guidance miss, collapsing the lofty 46x P/E ratio, while a break below key support at 178.70 could initiate a sharp decline toward 170, erasing billions in market value. Given these elevated and tangible risks, any exposure must be severely limited with a minimal position size and a stop loss tightly set below 178 to preserve capital for less precarious opportunities.\nNeutral Analyst: The Risky Analyst gambles by dismissing a concrete, state-mandated shipment blockade as mere noise, ignoring how such an immediate operational halt can crater the lofty valuation before fundamentals matter. Conversely, the Safe Analyst risks severe opportunity cost by advocating for near-total paralysis, which would cause one to miss the historic growth engine of the AI era on a temporary, albeit serious, friction. The risk-adjusted reality is that stellar fundamentals and dominant market position are currently in a high-uncertainty holding pattern, with technicals showing neutral consolidation and fading momentum. Therefore, the strategic compromise is to establish a small, non-leveraged core position now to maintain exposure, but to defer the majority of capital allocation until a decisive technical breakout above 193 resistance occurs, which would signal the market has discounted the near-term geopolitical risk.",
