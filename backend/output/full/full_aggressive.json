    "judge_decision": "{\n    \"recommendation\": \"SELL\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The debate confirms the original verdict is correct. The unanimous agreement on a 'severe fundamental data deficiency' (Neutral) and 'critical red flag' (Safe) creates an unacceptable, unquantifiable risk that overshadows any technical pattern. The Risky Analyst's bullish argument is speculative, treating this void as an opportunity rather than a disqualifying flaw. Crucially, the technical picture supports selling: the 'negative MACD divergence' (Safe) indicates waning momentum at a key resistance level (197.0), increasing the probability of a failure. Past mistakes from investing in informationally opaque assets emphasize that capital preservation is paramount. Therefore, the combination of a fundamental black box and deteriorating technicals justifies a decisive sell to avoid potential catastrophic loss.\",\n    \"refined_trader_plan\": \"Execute an urgent exit for any existing positions. Do not initiate new positions. The plan is defined by the following parameters: 1) **Action**: SELL at market. 2) **Stop Loss**: N/A (exit immediately). 3) **Position Size**: Zero exposure. 4) **Key Levels to Monitor**: A confirmed daily close below 190.5 support would validate the bearish thesis for further downside toward 185.5. A decisive breakout above 197.0 resistance, coupled with the sudden availability of audited financial statements showing strong health, would be the minimum requirement to reconsider a long bias. Until then, remain in cash.\"\n}",
    "history": "\nRisky Analyst: The Conservative and Neutral analysts are paralyzed by a lack of fundamentals, but that very uncertainty is where asymmetric opportunity is born. Their caution is a mistake, ignoring a powerful technical setup within a bullish trend, where price sits above all key moving averages and volume-weighted support. The growth thesis is clear: record-high gold prices directly boost the bank's capital markets and wealth management revenues, while consolidation near highs is a coiled spring, not a warning. With momentum merely pausing and sentiment neutral, this is the precise moment before a decisive breakout. Fortune favors the bold: buy aggressively on any dip, target a swift move above 197 resistance, and leverage this data vacuum for maximum reward.\nSafe Analyst: The Risky Analyst's aggressive optimism is dangerously speculative, treating a severe lack of fundamental data as an opportunity rather than the critical red flag it is. This trade is built on technical quicksand; the bullish trend is already showing a negative MACD divergence, and consolidation near the 197.0 resistance could easily fail. The worst-case scenario is a swift breakdown below the 190.5 support, triggered by the key risks identified: stronger US growth tightening global liquidity and pressuring emerging markets, which would expose KBANK's unquantifiable financial health. Without any visibility into debt, profitability, or cash flow, a moderate correction could become a catastrophic loss. Capital preservation demands an immediate defensive posture: any existing position must be minimal in size and protected by a very tight stop-loss, ideally below 190.0, to exit before a potential collapse.\nNeutral Analyst: The Risky Analyst's aggressive buy call is gambling, ignoring the severe fundamental data deficiency that makes any valuation impossible. The Safe Analyst's extreme caution, however, risks paralysis and opportunity cost by dismissing a still-intact bullish technical structure. The risk-adjusted reality is that price remains above key moving averages within a consolidation, supported by neutral sentiment and a potential revenue upside from gold prices. A strategic compromise is to maintain the HOLD stance but with a defined, active management plan: keep any position size minimal due to the fundamental black box, and use the identified technical boundaries (197.0 and 190.5) as clear triggers. Await a decisive breakout above resistance for a cautious add, or a breakdown below support for an immediate exit, thus balancing trend participation with capital preservation.",
