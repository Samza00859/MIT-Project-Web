    "key_risks_analysis": [
        "High Capital Intensity and Expenditure Requirements: Amazon's business model requires massive ongoing capital expenditures ($83.0 billion in 2024) for logistics, data centers, and technology, which could pressure free cash flow if growth investments do not yield adequate returns.",
        "Regulatory and Antitrust Scrutiny: As a global technology giant, Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny regarding market dominance, data privacy, and competitive practices, which could lead to fines, restrictions, or forced structural changes.",
        "Economic Cyclicality and Consumer Sensitivity: A significant portion of revenue derives from discretionary consumer spending on retail, which is vulnerable to economic downturns, inflation, and shifts in consumer confidence, potentially impacting growth and margins.",
        "Valuation Dependent on Sustained High Growth: The current Price to Earnings ratio of 34.86 implies investors expect continued high growth and margin expansion. Any slowdown in revenue growth or profitability could lead to significant multiple contraction and stock price volatility."
