    "recommendation": "SELL",
    "reasoning": "The Safe Analyst presents the most compelling case for immediate action, highlighting 'confirmed MACD bearish crossover, price below the 10 EMA and VWMA' indicating institutional distribution, compounded by 'fundamental overvaluation at a P/E of 36.62' and 'escalating regulatory fines forcing platform changes' that structurally threaten Apple's high-margin services revenue. This technical and fundamental deterioration outweighs the Risky Analyst's optimism about a future AI catalyst, which dismisses current risks as 'transient pressures' but fails to address the accelerating downside momentum. The Neutral Analyst's compromise of reducing position size risks opportunity cost and delays decisive risk management. Learning from past mistakes, holding during similar breakdowns has led to losses; thus, acting on clear bearish signals is critical to preserve capital. The verdict aligns with the trader's original SELL plan, reinforced by the debate's emphasis on urgent risk reduction.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Execute SELL order immediately to exit the position, targeting avoidance of a breakdown below key support at $269 (Bollinger lower band). Set a stop-loss at $271 if not sold, to limit downside. Monitor for a breach below $269, which could accelerate decline toward next support at $266.25. Post-sale, reassess entry only upon technical recovery above the 10 EMA and resolution of regulatory overhangs, focusing on AI catalyst developments for future opportunities."
