    "recommendation": "BUY",
    "reasoning": "The debate affirms the core bullish thesis: NVIDIA's unmatched competitive moat, exceptional financials (91.9% ROE, $60.85B FCF), and the concrete, imminent catalyst of H200 shipments to China in February 2026 provide a powerful fundamental foundation. Technically, the trend is bullish (price above key MAs, positive MACD histogram). However, the Neutral and Safe Analysts correctly identify the immediate risk of the price being at the upper Bollinger Band resistance, advocating for a disciplined entry to avoid buying at a short-term peak. The Risky Analyst's call for immediate action is countered by the historical lesson that chasing overbought levels often leads to immediate drawdowns before a catalyst materializes. Therefore, the optimal path integrates the momentum conviction of the Risky Analyst with the risk management of the Neutral and Safe Analysts: a scaled entry that captures upside while respecting price levels.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Execute a two-stage scaled BUY. 1) Initiate a starter position (30-40% of intended capital) on a pullback to the $182-$185 support zone (confluence of 10-day EMA and prior structure), with an initial stop-loss at $179.50 (below the $180 psychological support and 10-day EMA). 2) Add the remaining capital on a confirmed breakout and close above $190, with the stop-loss for the full position then moved to breakeven. Continuously monitor for P/E compression as the primary fundamental risk. This plan secures a favorable risk-adjusted entry, participates in the China catalyst momentum, and strictly defines risk per the Safe Analyst's warning."
