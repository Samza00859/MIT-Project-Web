    "recommendation": "SELL",
    "reasoning": "The debate confirms the original verdict is correct. The unanimous agreement on a 'severe fundamental data deficiency' (Neutral) and 'critical red flag' (Safe) creates an unacceptable, unquantifiable risk that overshadows any technical pattern. The Risky Analyst's bullish argument is speculative, treating this void as an opportunity rather than a disqualifying flaw. Crucially, the technical picture supports selling: the 'negative MACD divergence' (Safe) indicates waning momentum at a key resistance level (197.0), increasing the probability of a failure. Past mistakes from investing in informationally opaque assets emphasize that capital preservation is paramount. Therefore, the combination of a fundamental black box and deteriorating technicals justifies a decisive sell to avoid potential catastrophic loss.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Execute an urgent exit for any existing positions. Do not initiate new positions. The plan is defined by the following parameters: 1) **Action**: SELL at market. 2) **Stop Loss**: N/A (exit immediately). 3) **Position Size**: Zero exposure. 4) **Key Levels to Monitor**: A confirmed daily close below 190.5 support would validate the bearish thesis for further downside toward 185.5. A decisive breakout above 197.0 resistance, coupled with the sudden availability of audited financial statements showing strong health, would be the minimum requirement to reconsider a long bias. Until then, remain in cash."
