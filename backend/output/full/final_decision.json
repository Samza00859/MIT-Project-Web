### Portfolio Manager Decision
{
    "recommendation": "BUY",
    "reasoning": "The debate solidifies the bullish investment thesis: Risky Analyst's emphasis on 'AWS margin expansion accelerating with a $200 billion backlog' and net income of $59 billion underscores fundamental strength, while Neutral Analyst notes the 'bullish long-term trend supported by fundamentals and volume.' However, Safe Analyst's warnings on 'waning momentum with a declining MACD histogram' and resistance at $246.29 highlight short-term risks. Learning from past mistakes, avoiding aggressive leverage and incorporating technical risk management is key. The Neutral Analyst's balanced approach of a 'standard, non-leveraged long position' with support-based adds offers the best risk-adjusted path, aligning with the trader's original bullish plan while mitigating over-optimism.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Initiate a long position in Amazon at current levels with a standard position size (e.g., 50-70% of allocated capital), avoiding leverage. Set a stop-loss below the VWMA support at $232.79 to manage downside risk. Target a decisive break above immediate resistance at $246.29 to add to the position, aiming for the November high of $250.20. Use the support zone near $232 as an opportunity to average down if the stock holds, but maintain the stop-loss to protect against a technical breakdown. Continuously monitor AWS margin reports and regulatory developments for any material changes."
