    "recommendation": "BUY",
    "reasoning": "The debate highlights a conflict between NVIDIA's extraordinary fundamental strength (125% YoY revenue growth, 55.8% net margins, surging AI demand) and near-term bearish technical momentum (price below key moving averages, risk of breaking $174.80 support). The Risky Analyst's conviction in the long-term story is compelling, but the Safe and Neutral Analysts correctly emphasize the need for disciplined risk management given the potential for a 5-6% swift decline. The Neutral Analyst's proposal for a scaled entry offers the optimal risk-adjusted path: it respects the current bearish pressure while positioning for a rebound within the intact long-term uptrend. This approach learns from past mistakes of either ignoring technical breakdowns (leading to large drawdowns) or waiting for perfect signals (missing entries). Thus, a BUY decision is warranted, but executed with a refined, risk-conscious plan.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Initiate a scaled long entry: 1) Buy 50% of the intended position size at current levels (~$174.80-$175). Place a tight stop-loss at $174.50 (just below the Bollinger support). 2) If the stop is hit, exit fully and reassess. 3) For the remaining 50% capital, only deploy upon a confirmed bullish reversal signal: a break above the 10-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on increasing volume. The final stop-loss for the full position, once both entries are filled, will be adjusted to the 200-day Simple Moving Average at $156.32. The target is a move above the 50-day SMA resistance. This plan balances conviction with capital preservation."
