### Portfolio Manager Decision
{
    "recommendation": "SELL",
    "reasoning": "The debate highlights severe overvaluation and technical exhaustion, with the Safe Analyst's arguments being most compelling. The Price to Earnings Ratio of 36.62 is unsustainable without flawless execution, and escalating regulatory fines in Italy and Brazil threaten high-margin revenue streams. Technically, the Relative Strength Index at 83.25 indicates extreme overbought conditions that historically precede sharp corrections, and price stalling at the 247.10 resistance suggests distribution. The Risky Analyst's focus on the 2026 AI catalyst ignores near-term risks and the high probability of multiple compression, while the Neutral Analyst's compromise of a partial hold still exposes capital to a significant corrective pullback. Past lessons emphasize that ignoring overbought signals and failing to lock in gains during euphoria leads to capital destruction. Therefore, a decisive exit is warranted to preserve profits and avoid a potential decline toward the 236.18 VWMA support or lower.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Execute a full exit by selling the entire position immediately at market price to lock in gains. If the stock gaps down, use a limit order slightly below the current price to ensure execution. Post-exit, monitor for a corrective pullback to the 236.18 VWMA support level. Consider re-evaluating for a potential re-entry only if the stock consolidates healthily, regulatory concerns abate, and the RSI returns to neutral levels (below 70). No new long positions should be initiated until these conditions are met."
