### Portfolio Manager Decision
{
    "recommendation": "BUY",
    "reasoning": "The Risky Analyst correctly emphasizes Nvidia's 'historic' financials and the 'temporary, solvable speed bump' of the China H200 blockade, while the Safe Analyst provides a necessary caution regarding the 'direct, state-mandated blockade' and technical risks (negative MACD, key resistance). The Neutral Analyst's 'strategic compromise' best synthesizes these views, advocating for a risk-adjusted approach that avoids the paralysis of excessive caution and the recklessness of ignoring immediate headwinds. Past trading mistakes underscore the danger of either full paralysis or unhedged aggression in the face of uncertainty. Therefore, the decision is to buy, but with a disciplined, phased plan that respects both the long-term thesis and near-term risks.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Initiate a reduced core position (25-33% of intended full allocation) at current levels between 178 and 193. Place a hard stop loss at 177.70 (below the 178.70 key support) to limit downside. Defer the majority of capital (67-75%) until a decisive daily close above the 193.29 resistance level, confirming that the market has discounted the near-term geopolitical overhang. This staged entry maintains exposure to Nvidia's AI dominance while strictly managing the immediate operational and technical risks identified in the debate."
