    "recommendation": "BUY",
    "reasoning": "The debate reinforces Apple's compelling long-term bullish thesis, with Risky Analyst highlighting 'rock-solid' structure above the 200-day SMA and 'explosive' growth from AI monetization and iPhone demand, supported by strong fundamentals like 152% ROE and $98.8B free cash flow. Neutral Analyst acknowledges a 'healthy consolidation within a bullish trend,' validating the pullback as a potential entry. Safe Analyst's concerns on technical distribution and regulatory risks are valid but mitigated by risk management; e.g., the stock testing Bollinger lower band at $269.64 offers defined support. Past lessons emphasize avoiding impulsive buys without stops, so incorporating a tight stop-loss balances opportunity with downside protection. The asymmetric upside to analyst targets like $315 outweighs short-term risks when managed prudently.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Buy urgently at approximately $270, as per original plan, but with refined risk controls: set a stop-loss at $269.00 (just below the Bollinger lower band at $269.64) to guard against breakdown. Use a moderate position size (e.g., 60-70% of full allocation) to preserve capital for potential adds if price dips to $266.25, as Neutral Analyst suggested. Initial profit targets at $274 and $278, with longer-term hold toward $315 based on catalyst realization. Continuously monitor regulatory developments and AI execution risks, as highlighted in the original plan."
