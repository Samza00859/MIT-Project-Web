    "recommendation": "BUY",
    "reasoning": "The Risky Analyst's emphasis on the confirmed long-term bullish trend with price significantly above the 200-day SMA and strong fundamentals (8% YoY revenue growth, 18% ROE) provides a compelling basis for action. However, the Safe Analyst's warnings about short-term deterioration—bearish MACD crossover, price below 10 EMA, and declining RSI—highlight valid risks that cannot be ignored. The Neutral Analyst's scaled entry approach effectively balances these perspectives, allowing participation in the uptrend while managing downside risk. Learning from past mistakes of entering full positions without confirmation, a phased strategy reduces exposure to false signals. Thus, despite short-term noise, the long-term outlook justifies a BUY recommendation with enhanced risk management.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Execute a scaled buy: initiate a 50% position at current levels near the 50-day SMA support at $674.79, with a tight stop-loss at $672.00 (just below support). Target the Bollinger Upper Band at $697.69 for partial profit-taking. Reserve the remaining 50% to add only upon a decisive daily close above the 10-day EMA, confirming momentum recovery. Continuously monitor for a break below the 50-day SMA, which would invalidate the trade and require full exit."
