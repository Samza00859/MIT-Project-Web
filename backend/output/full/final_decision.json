    "recommendation": "SELL",
    "reasoning": "The debate validates the original Sell verdict, with the Safe Analyst's technical warnings being most compelling. The negative MACD histogram and crossover, price at the Bollinger Upper Band ($79.79), and RSI nearing overbought territory signal momentum deceleration after a parabolic rally to a 25-year high, creating a high-risk, low-reward scenario. The Risky Analyst's AI narrative is acknowledged but does not outweigh the immediate downside risk to support levels like the 50-day SMA ($71.46). The Neutral Analyst's call for caution reinforces avoiding new exposure. Past lessons highlight that ignoring such technical divergences at historic highs often leads to losses, prioritizing capital preservation over speculative breakout chasing.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Execute sell orders at current market strength or on any push toward $79.79. Avoid new long positions entirely. For existing holdings, consider a tight stop-loss at $74.89 (Bollinger middle band) to limit downside, as per Safe and Neutral insights. Monitor for a potential correction to key support ($71.46) for future re-entry if technical conditions stabilize, but maintain a defensive stance until momentum confirms renewed bullish structure."
