    "recommendation": "SELL",
    "reasoning": "The Safe and Neutral analysts provide the most compelling and risk-conscious arguments, but the Safe analyst's specific warning of a 'potential breakdown' with 'negative MACD and declining volume—classic signs of distribution' justifies immediate action over the Neutral analyst's wait-and-see HOLD. The Risky analyst's bullish trend and macro catalyst are acknowledged but deemed insufficient against the clear technical deterioration and fundamental vulnerability. The stock's high leverage (Debt to Equity of 5.85) and slowing domestic economy, as highlighted by the Safe analyst, create significant downside risk that the temporary foreign inflows cannot reliably offset. The price action at the critical 190.5 support level presents an unfavorable risk-reward; waiting for a confirmed break, as Neutral suggests, could mean accepting a larger loss. The preemptive SELL is chosen to preserve capital.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Execute SELL order at market price upon receipt of this verdict. No new position should be initiated. Capital is to be preserved and redeployed only upon a clear reversal of the bearish technical structure (e.g., a reclaim of the 190.5 level as support with bullish volume confirmation) and/or a material improvement in the fundamental outlook. Monitor for a reversal in the Thai Baht strength and global risk sentiment as key risks to the bearish thesis."
