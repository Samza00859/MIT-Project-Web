    "recommendation": "BUY",
    "reasoning": "The Risky Analyst's arguments for a long-term bullish outlook are compelling: price remains above the 200-day SMA, confirming a steadfast uptrend, and the pullback to the $268 support confluence (50-day SMA and Bollinger Lower Band) offers a high-probability entry. Fundamental catalysts like Siri 2.0 AI integration and Morgan Stanley's $315 price target signal strong growth. However, the Safe Analyst's warnings about technical deterioration—price below 10 EMA, declining MACD histogram, and risk of a breakdown below $268—are valid and must be heeded to avoid past mistakes of ignoring momentum risks. The Neutral Analyst's compromise of a partial position balances these views. Learning from prior misjudgments, a phased approach with strict risk management is prudent to capitalize on the dip while respecting short-term selling pressure.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Initiate a partial long position at current levels near $268, with a tight stop-loss order placed below $267 (as per Safe Analyst's risk management). Reserve capital to average down if the price confirms stability by reclaiming the 10-day EMA or if the MACD histogram flattens, improving the entry. Monitor for a sustained breakdown below $268 support, which would invalidate the bullish thesis and necessitate exit. This plan aligns with the long-term bullish narrative while mitigating near-term technical risks."
