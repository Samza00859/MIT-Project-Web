    "recommendation": "SELL",
    "reasoning": "The initial assessment of 'significant and persistent systemic risks' and an 'unacceptable level of uncertainty for long-term investment' remains the overriding concern and is strongly reinforced by the Safe and Neutral analysts. While Risky analyst highlights Tencent's 'audacious workaround that fuels innovation' by securing Nvidia chips, Safe analyst critically counters that 'this workaround highlights their vulnerability to geopolitical tensions, particularly US-China relations,' a point Neutral also acknowledges as 'persistent geopolitical risks.' This demonstrates that the strategic vulnerability, not just the tactical agility, is paramount for risk management. Furthermore, the technical indicators consistently paint a bearish picture, with the stock 'below key moving averages, nearing the lower Bollinger Band, and the MACD shows bearish momentum,' as noted by Safe, suggesting 'further declines are likely, potentially towards the 602.00 support level.' Neutral analyst concurs, stating 'The technical indicators undeniably signal a bearish trend and potential for further decline, a critical risk factor.' This strong technical alignment with the original bearish view cannot be ignored. The absence of crucial valuation data, such as the Price to Earnings Ratio, as noted in the original plan, continues to prevent a confident assessment of the stock's intrinsic attractiveness, making any bullish stance speculative given the unmitigated risks. Learning from past misjudgments involves prioritizing capital preservation when systemic risks are high, technicals are bearish, and fundamental valuation clarity is lacking, rather than gambling on operational workarounds. The prudent course is to avoid potential substantial losses by liquidating the position.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Immediately execute a full SELL of all existing positions to protect capital. The rationale for this immediate action is anchored in the persistent systemic geopolitical risks and consistently bearish technical indicators. Closely monitor for any substantial de-escalation of US-China geopolitical tensions that genuinely alleviates the chip supply vulnerability, or a decisive and sustained reversal in technical indicators, specifically a break and hold above key moving averages and established resistance levels. Re-evaluate any investment decision only if comprehensive valuation data becomes available, demonstrating a compelling undervaluation that clearly outweighs the identified geopolitical and technical risks."
