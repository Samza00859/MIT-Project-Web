{
    "recommendation": "SELL",
    "reasoning": "The decision to SELL is firmly rooted in the overwhelming evidence of severe financial distress and strong bearish technical signals, which the Safe Analyst most effectively articulated and aligns with the trader's initial assessment. The company's 'persistent net losses, a deeply negative and deteriorating free cash flow, and a highly leveraged balance sheet' represent a fundamental inability to generate sustainable profits, as highlighted by the Safe Analyst's argument that 'revenue growth... is dwarfed by persistent net losses and deteriorating free cash flow.' This fundamental weakness is the most critical risk to capital. Furthermore, the technical landscape reinforces an immediate exit, with the 'approaching 'death cross' and price trading below key moving averages and the middle Bollinger Band signal further downside risk,' as accurately identified by the Safe Analyst. While Risky Analyst points to 'staggering seventy percent revenue growth' and 'explosive potential,' this growth is unsustainable without a credible path to profitability and positive cash flow, making the investment highly speculative and reliant on continuous external funding. The Neutral Analyst's suggestion to 'initiate a small, speculative position... with a very tight stop-loss order placed just below the critical 4.63 support level' is a compromise that, while attempting to mitigate risk, still advocates for initiating a long position against severe fundamental and technical headwinds. This does not meet the criteria of being 'strongly justified' for a 'Hold' recommendation, especially when the trader's primary goal is capital protection from a highly distressed asset. Learning from past mistakes dictates avoiding speculative bets against clear financial and technical warnings. A decisive SELL protects capital from further declines in a company that struggles with core financial health and shows clear technical signs of weakness.",
    "refined_trader_plan": "Execute an immediate and full SELL of the entire position. The primary objective is capital preservation given the company's severe financial distress, characterized by persistent net losses, deeply negative and deteriorating free cash flow, and a highly leveraged balance sheet. The strong bearish technical signals, including the price trading below the 50-day Simple Moving Average and the 10-day Exponential Moving Average, a negative Moving Average Convergence Divergence, and an impending death cross, indicate significant immediate downside risk. Critical support levels at 4.63 and 4.99 should be monitored, as a breach would confirm further declines. Re-evaluation for a potential entry can only be considered if there is definitive, sustained evidence of a clear and credible path to profitability and positive free cash flow, along with a confirmed reversal in technical trends, none of which are currently present."
