Execute a HOLD strategy on AMZN, acknowledging the established bullish long-term thesis while navigating current consolidation. Given the waning short-term momentum indicated by declining MACD and RSI, and the mixed sentiment backdrop, avoid aggressive new long entries. Instead, monitor the stock’s behavior around the 10-day EMA/VWMA support level, which currently sits near 127.80, as a potential entry point if accompanied by renewed upward momentum. A hard stop loss will be placed at 124.50 to mitigate downside risk, representing a 3% allocation of available capital. A take profit target will be evaluated upon a confirmed break above the 246.29 resistance, contingent on improved technical indicators.
