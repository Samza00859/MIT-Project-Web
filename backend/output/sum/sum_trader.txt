Given the current confluence of bullish momentum and robust fundamentals, we will maintain a HOLD position on ADVANC.BK, acknowledging the technical indication of an overbought condition as reflected by the RSI at 82.29. We will closely monitor the price action around the 50-SMA at $150, with a hard stop loss placed at $147.50 to mitigate downside risk. The position size will be 50% of allocated capital, reflecting a moderate risk tolerance while allowing for flexibility to adjust based on evolving market dynamics. Should the price decisively break below the $147.50 level, indicating a potential trend reversal, we will re-evaluate for a potential SELL. Conversely, if the price demonstrates resilience and consolidates above the $150 mark, we will continue to hold, anticipating a resolution of the overbought condition. Enter only upon market open, closely observing volume and momentum indicators for confirmation of our strategy.
