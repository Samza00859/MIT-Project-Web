Given the current confluence of bearish technical indicators and negative news catalysts surrounding NVDA, the strategy will be to hold the existing position while closely monitoring the $174.67 level, which represents a critical support zone. A breakdown below this level would invalidate the buy thesis and necessitate a reduction of the position to mitigate downside risk, targeting the 200 SMA at $156.63 as a potential hard stop loss. Conversely, a sustained reversal signaled by reclaiming the 10 EMA and 50 SMA with increased volume would warrant reevaluation of the position and potential accumulation. The current position size will remain unchanged, reflecting a cautious approach due to the elevated near-term execution risk.
