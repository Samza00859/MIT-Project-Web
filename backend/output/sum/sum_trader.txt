Execute a scaled entry on a Breakout Long, initiating a starter position immediately to capitalize on confirmed bullish momentum and the anticipated China H200 export catalyst. Allocate a portion of the intended capital now, targeting an initial entry around the current price. Reserve the majority of capital for a potential pullback to the $182-$185 support zone, where the 50 SMA and rising VWMA converge, offering a more favorable entry point. A hard stop loss will be placed below the 10 EMA at $180.99, mitigating downside risk should the breakout fail. Avoid chasing the price above $190, prioritizing disciplined risk management. Enter only upon market open, closely monitoring the China export timeline and the 10 EMA for any adverse signals requiring stop-loss adjustment.
