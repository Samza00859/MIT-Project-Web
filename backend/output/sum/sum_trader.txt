Maintaining the existing position, the strategy dictates a HOLD stance given the prevailing bullish trend and supportive Baht inflows. We will closely monitor the 190.5 support level; a decisive breach below this level accompanied by increased volume and a weakening Baht would necessitate a re-evaluation towards a potential SELL. The current position size reflects a calculated risk tolerance, designed to withstand short-term volatility while preserving capital. Should the price action confirm a breakdown through 190.5, triggering a SELL order, we will execute at the next available opportunity, prioritizing minimizing slippage. Entry will be considered only upon market open, allowing for a clear assessment of overnight developments and initial intraday price behavior.
