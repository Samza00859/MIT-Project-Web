Execute an immediate sell order to capitalize on the current overbought condition and mounting negative catalysts. Initiate the position at the prevailing market price, targeting a hard stop loss at 236.18, coinciding with the Volume Weighted Moving Average, to mitigate potential downside risk. The position size will be allocated to represent a 2% risk of the total trading capital, reflecting the high-probability mean reversion setup driven by an RSI of 83.25, elevated P/E ratio of 36.62, and recent regulatory fines in Italy and Brazil alongside insider selling. Monitor price action closely; a decisive breach above the 247.10 resistance level would invalidate the trade thesis, while a sustained decline below 236.18 would signal a broader correction and necessitate further adjustments. Enter the sell order now, prioritizing swift execution to capture the anticipated pullback.
