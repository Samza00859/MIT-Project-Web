Given the current confluence of bullish technical indicators and positive fundamental growth drivers, we will maintain a HOLD position on AMD. While the elevated P/E ratio and potential impact of US tariffs warrant caution, the market appears to be factoring in anticipated growth and rewarding AMD’s AI positioning. We will closely monitor support levels at 214.95 and 213.43, with a hard stop loss placed at 213.43 to mitigate downside risk. Conversely, resistance levels at 223.47 and 227.15 will serve as potential profit targets. The position size will remain consistent with our established risk parameters, allocating no more than 2% of capital per trade. We will await clearer indications of a trend reversal or a more substantial impact from the tariffs before considering any adjustments to the position. Enter only upon market open, with continuous monitoring of upcoming earnings reports and developments regarding US-China trade relations and chip tariffs.
