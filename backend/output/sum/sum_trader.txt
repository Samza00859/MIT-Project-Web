Execute an immediate sell order to reduce exposure, predicated on observed distribution patterns and heightened near-term risks stemming from China export uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Initiate the position at the prevailing market price, targeting a hard stop loss at 184.55 to mitigate accelerated downside risk should support fail. The position size will represent 25% of allocated capital, reflecting the conviction in the deteriorating technical picture—a negative MACD histogram and consolidation near the middle Bollinger Band—coupled with the failure to sustain gains above the 189 resistance level. Re-entry will be considered only upon a confirmed reclaim of 189 resistance accompanied by strengthening momentum, or following a washout to the 178 support level alongside a resolution of concerns regarding Chinese export data.
