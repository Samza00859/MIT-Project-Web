Execute a HOLD strategy on the current position, acknowledging strong underlying fundamentals overshadowed by immediate operational headwinds. The stock is currently consolidating, exhibiting indecisive technical action and facing uncertainty regarding Chinese customs’ blockage of H200 shipments, directly impacting production and revenue. Maintain the existing position, with a hard stop loss placed at 187.50 to mitigate downside risk should the consolidation deepen. A potential entry point for a long position will be considered only upon a decisive breakout above the 193 resistance level, accompanied by substantial volume, validating the bullish thesis. Position sizing will be limited to 25% of available capital, reflecting the elevated risk profile due to the unresolved China situation. Enter only after assessing the market open and confirming the absence of further negative news flow concerning the H200 shipments.
