Given the conflicting signals and prevailing bearish technicals, we will maintain a HOLD position, closely monitoring support levels for potential catalysts. We will initiate a cautious BUY strategy if the price demonstrates resilience around the 610.00 level, allocating 25% of available capital to this trade. A hard stop loss will be placed at 602.24, representing a 1.5% risk per share, designed to protect against a breakdown of support. Should the price action confirm positive momentum and breach the 615.00 resistance, we will consider scaling into a full position, increasing exposure by another 50% of available capital. Conversely, a sustained break below 602.24 will trigger an immediate liquidation of the existing position. Enter only upon market open, observing initial price action for confirmation of support or continued downward pressure.
