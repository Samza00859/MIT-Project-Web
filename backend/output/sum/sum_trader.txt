Given the current technical landscape, we will maintain a HOLD position, recognizing the intact long-term bullish trend despite recent short-term deterioration. While the fundamental catalysts remain favorable, including AI advancements, a price target upgrade, and ongoing buybacks, immediate action is premature. We will await confirmation of stabilization around the $268 support zone, a critical level representing a confluence of support. Should price decisively break below $268, a SELL signal will be triggered. Conversely, a BUY will be considered upon a confirmed bounce from $268, evidenced by a flattening of the MACD histogram or a reclaim of the 10 EMA. Initial position size will be limited to 25% of allocated capital, with a hard stop loss set at $265 to mitigate downside risk. Enter only upon market open, pending the aforementioned technical confirmations.
