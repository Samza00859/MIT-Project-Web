Given the conflicting signals, we will maintain a HOLD position on PTT.BK, observing for further market development. While the RSI registers at 71.77, indicating overbought conditions and proximity to the upper Bollinger Band, the prevailing bullish trend and robust fundamentals necessitate caution. We will monitor the price action closely, establishing a hard stop loss at 33.50 THB to mitigate downside risk should a significant reversal materialize. A potential take profit target will be evaluated based on a confirmed break below the 32.80 THB level, signaling a shift in momentum. The position size will remain consistent with our standard risk parameters, allocating approximately 2% of capital to this trade. Entry will occur only upon market open, allowing for a clear assessment of initial price movement and confirming the absence of an immediate, sharp correction.
