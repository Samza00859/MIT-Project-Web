Given the confluence of robust fundamentals and emerging bearish technicals, we will maintain a HOLD position, observing for a potential entry point. Current conditions indicate accelerating downward momentum, suggesting a likely test of the $174.80 support level, defined by the Bollinger Lower Band. Should this level fail, invalidating the near-term support thesis, we will re-evaluate. Conversely, a confirmed bullish reversal—specifically, a decisive break above the 10-EMA accompanied by increased volume—or a move into oversold territory (RSI below 30) will trigger a long initiation. We will size the position to represent no more than 1% of capital, placing a hard stop-loss at $174.80 to mitigate downside risk. Entry will be considered only upon the aforementioned market triggers, prioritizing risk management over immediate participation.
