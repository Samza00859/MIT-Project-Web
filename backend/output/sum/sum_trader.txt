Given the current market conditions and conflicting signals, we will maintain a HOLD position. While the long-term uptrend remains intact above the 200 Simple Moving Average, short-term momentum has weakened considerably, evidenced by a bearish MACD crossover and price action below both the 10 Exponential Moving Average and Volume Weighted Moving Average. We will closely monitor the $674.79 level, representing the 50 SMA, as a critical support point. A confirmed bounce from this level would trigger a potential BUY signal, allowing us to initiate a position with a 2% allocation of capital, targeting an initial take profit at $685. Conversely, a decisive breach below $674.79 will necessitate a SELL order to mitigate downside risk. Enter only upon market open, awaiting confirmation of either a bullish reversal or continued bearish momentum.
