Given the prevailing bearish technicals, negative sentiment, and emerging regulatory risks surrounding NVDA, the strategy will remain on hold, preserving capital for a higher-probability entry. While acknowledging the company’s strong fundamentals, current price action indicates continued selling pressure, increasing the risk of attempting an immediate accumulation. We will monitor for a technical stabilization signal, specifically a decisive reclaim of the 10-day EMA around $180, coupled with a bullish MACD crossover, as a potential trigger for initiating a buy. Should these conditions materialize, a position size of 25% of allocated capital will be deployed, with a hard stop loss set just below the lower Bollinger Band at $174.67 to mitigate downside risk. Entry will only occur upon confirmation of these signals during the market open, allowing for optimal timing and risk management.
