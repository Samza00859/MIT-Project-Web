Given the mixed intelligence and prevailing bullish technical signals, we will maintain a HOLD position on the asset. The current valuation, while premium, is partially supported by robust fundamentals and sustained demand within the AI sector. We will actively monitor the evolving situation concerning China export regulations; a decisive breakdown below the $180 support level, coupled with further negative news flow, would trigger a re-evaluation of a potential SELL. Until then, we will maintain our existing position size, representing a 2% allocation of capital, with a hard stop loss placed at $175 to mitigate downside risk. The take profit target remains contingent on a clear shift in market sentiment and confirmation of a bearish trend, currently not warranted. Enter only upon market open, continuously assessing the developing landscape.
