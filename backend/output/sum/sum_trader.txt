Given the current market conditions and intelligence surrounding AAPL, the strategy will be to maintain a HOLD position, closely monitoring the critical support zone between $269.64 and $266.25. While the long-term thesis remains favorable, technical indicators suggest a corrective phase with price action below the VWMA and 10 EMA, signaling potential distribution. Fundamentals also present concerns with a high P/E ratio of 36.62 and elevated debt-to-equity ratio of 3.87, compounded by recent regulatory fines. A position will not be initiated until a confirmed bounce occurs from the $269.64 support level, accompanied by improving momentum—specifically, an RSI exceeding 50 and a positive MACDh crossover—or a more attractive valuation presents itself. Should the price decisively breach the $266.25 level, a reevaluation of the long-term thesis will be necessary. Enter only upon market open, observing these levels diligently.
