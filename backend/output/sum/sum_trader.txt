Given the prevailing bullish technicals and supportive energy market conditions, we will maintain a HOLD position in BCP.BK. The decision is predicated on the observation of price consistently trading above key moving averages, coupled with positive momentum signals from the MACD and RSI, despite valuation concerns regarding the elevated P/E ratio and relatively low net profit margin. We will defend the position with a hard stop loss placed at $36.50, representing a 3% downside risk, while targeting a take profit level of $42.00, reflecting a potential 15% gain. This position size will represent 2% of allocated capital, balancing risk exposure against the anticipated upside potential. Entry will occur immediately, contingent upon confirmation of continued upward price action and absence of any adverse shifts in technical indicators or a material improvement in the net profit margin.
