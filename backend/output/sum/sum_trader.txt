Maintain the current long position, recognizing the ongoing bullish trend despite a potential tactical pullback. A hard stop-loss will be placed at $74.89, aligning with the Bollinger middle band and recent consolidation level, to protect against an unexpected downside move. New capital should be deployed on a pullback toward the 50 SMA at $71.46, avoiding any short initiation given the prevailing bullish momentum. Position sizing for new entries will be determined based on risk tolerance, aiming for no more than 1% of total capital per trade, acknowledging the potential for continued upward movement following this historic breakout. Monitor the MACD for confirmation of a bullish crossover resumption, which will serve as an additional signal for further accumulation. Enter only upon market open.
