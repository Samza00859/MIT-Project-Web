Given the prevailing bearish technical indicators and overvalued fundamentals, we will maintain a HOLD position, refraining from an aggressive BUY despite the recent AI partnership news. We will closely monitor the price action, specifically targeting a potential entry zone around $175 if the MACD exhibits a bullish crossover and the price decisively breaks above both the 10-day EMA and 50-day SMA. However, a hard stop loss will be implemented at $168 to mitigate downside risk, representing a 3% allocation of available capital. Should the price fail to demonstrate sustained bullish momentum and instead breaches below the 50-day SMA, invalidating the AI narrative, we will re-evaluate our stance. Enter only upon market open, contingent on observing the aforementioned technical confirmations.
