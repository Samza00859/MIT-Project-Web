Given the current consolidation pattern in PTT.BK, we will maintain a HOLD position, acknowledging solid fundamentals offset by waning technical momentum and inherent sector risks. We will closely monitor price action around the 37.50 THB resistance level and the 35.80 THB support level, establishing a hard stop loss at 35.50 THB to mitigate downside exposure. The position size will be limited to 25% of allocated capital, reflecting the fairly valued status and potential for sideways movement. A decisive breach of either the 37.50 THB resistance or the 35.80 THB support will trigger a reevaluation of the strategy, potentially leading to an adjustment in position. Enter only upon market open, pending confirmation of sustained price action beyond these key levels.
