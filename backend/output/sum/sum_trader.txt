Given the current market conditions and fundamental vulnerabilities, we will maintain a HOLD position on the asset. We will closely monitor commodity price trends and the company’s ability to sustain profit margins. A potential entry point for a long position will materialize if the price decisively breaks above the 50-day Simple Moving Average and recent highs, targeting an initial take profit level around that breakout zone. However, to mitigate risk, a hard stop loss will be placed just below the 50-day SMA, protecting against a reversal. The position size will be calibrated to represent no more than 1% of allocated capital, reflecting the inherent volatility and thin profit margins. Enter only upon market open, contingent on observing sustained upward momentum and confirmation of a breach through the identified resistance levels.
