Given the current assessment, we will maintain a HOLD position in PTT.BK, recognizing the technical overbought conditions—RSI at 77.62 and proximity to the upper Bollinger Band—are counterbalanced by the positive strategic LNG procurement agreement and robust underlying fundamentals. We will actively monitor price action, establishing a hard stop loss at 34.50 THB to protect against unexpected downside pressure stemming from broader global macroeconomic headwinds. Should the price consolidate or experience a minor pullback, we will consider initiating a cautious BUY position around 33.80 THB, targeting a take profit level of 36.20 THB, representing a measured move based on recent volatility. The position size will be limited to 25% of available capital, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in the global market environment and allowing for flexibility in adjusting our stance as conditions evolve. Enter only upon market open, closely observing initial price movement for confirmation of consolidation patterns.
