Maintain the existing position, observing a consolidation phase within a broader uptrend. Given the current price of 242.60, a tactical pause is warranted, avoiding new capital deployment until clarity emerges. Should the price resolve decisively above the 247.38 resistance level, initiate a momentum buy, allocating 25% of available capital with a hard stop loss placed at 240. Alternatively, if a high-volume washout occurs towards the 50-day SMA around 234, consider a value buy, risking 15% of available capital with a stop loss positioned just below 230. Closely monitor news flow regarding regulatory developments and competitive pressures; any adverse changes will necessitate a reevaluation of the position. Enter only upon market open, awaiting confirmation of either a breakout or a significant pullback.
