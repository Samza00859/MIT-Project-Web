Technically Bullish, AAPL demonstrates a robust long-term uptrend confirmed by its position well above both the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, despite a recent minor pullback evidenced by the 10-day EMA nearing the current price. Momentum remains strong as indicated by the MACD line above the signal line and a positive histogram, although the histogram's deceleration hints at a potential loss of upward thrust. Volume conditions are neutral, contributing to a moderate level of volatility as reflected in the ATR. The Relative Strength Index registers at an extreme 83.25, signaling overbought conditions and increasing the likelihood of a near-term consolidation or corrective pullback towards support around the 236.18 VWMA and potentially testing the 232.80 swing low. Immediate resistance lies near 247.10, with further upside targets extending to the 250-263 range should that level be breached. Therefore, wait for a pullback to the 236.18 area before considering a re-entry, prioritizing risk management given the overbought RSI.
