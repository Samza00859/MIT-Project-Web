Technically bullish, PTT.BK exhibits robust upward momentum underpinned by a confluence of positive indicators. The price, currently trading near its recent high and hugging the upper Bollinger Band, demonstrates persistent buying pressure confirmed by the close residing well above both the 50-day SMA and the 10-day EMA. The MACD's position above its signal line, coupled with a positive histogram, reinforces the strengthening bullish trend, while the Volume Weighted Moving Average further validates the price action. Although the Relative Strength Index registers as overbought at 71.77, suggesting a potential for a short-term consolidation, the overall market sentiment remains firmly bullish. Immediate support lies around the 33.25 level, with resistance observed near 33.75, presenting tactical entry and exit points. Traders should await a potential pullback toward the 33.00 area before considering further long positions, capitalizing on any temporary weakness to initiate or add to existing exposure.
