Technically Bullish, AMZN demonstrates sustained upward momentum despite a recent consolidation phase following a robust rally from October lows. The price, currently trading around 242.60, remains comfortably above both the 50-day simple moving average and the 10-day exponential moving average, reinforcing the intermediate and short-term bullish trends. While the MACD histogram shows a slight deceleration from previous highs, the overall MACD line remains positive, suggesting that bullish sentiment persists. The Relative Strength Index, though retreating from overbought conditions, sits at 60.69, indicating neutral-bullish territory. Price action is currently testing support near the 10-day EMA and VWMA, while facing resistance around the recent high of approximately 246.29 and the November peak near 250.20. Volume conditions remain neutral, and volatility, as measured by the Average True Range, has moderated from its November peaks. Given this configuration, the actionable setup involves waiting for a pullback to the vicinity of the 10-day EMA and VWMA before considering a re-entry, contingent upon a decisive bounce confirming continued bullish trajectory.
