Technically Bearish, 0700.HK presents a compelling case for continued downside pressure as evidenced by its persistent position below both the 50-day Simple Moving Average and the 10-day Exponential Moving Average, reinforcing a prevailing bearish trend. Momentum remains weak, confirmed by the MACD line residing below the signal line and a declining MACD histogram, while volume continues to diminish, suggesting waning conviction behind the current move. The Relative Strength Index hovers in oversold territory below 30, potentially signaling either a temporary reprieve or a continuation of the existing sell-off, though it does not negate the broader bearish outlook. Price action is currently testing near recent lows, finding initial support around 602.00, while resistance looms at 630.00 and further up at 640.00, representing significant hurdles for any potential rebound. Given these conditions, the actionable setup involves waiting for a pullback towards the 602.00 level before considering a short position, acknowledging the inherent risks associated with trading in oversold conditions.
