Technically Bearish, 0700.HK exhibits a confluence of negative signals suggesting continued downside pressure. Momentum is weak, confirmed by the MACD trending below its signal line and a widening negative histogram, while the RSI hovers in oversold territory below 30, indicating persistent selling. Volume is rising, amplifying the bearish sentiment. Price action is currently near recent lows, trading below both the 10-day and 50-day EMAs, and well below the VWMA, reinforcing the short-term downtrend despite remaining above the 200-day SMA, which suggests a longer-term bullish foundation. Key resistance lies around 644.00, 651.00, and 660.00, while potential support can be found near 610.00 and 602.24. The stock's proximity to the lower Bollinger Band raises concerns about a potential breakdown, and the divergence between short-term bearishness and the long-term trend warrants close observation. Wait for a pullback towards the 610.00 level before considering any long positions, prioritizing risk management given the prevailing bearish momentum.
