Technically Bullish, AMZN exhibits robust underlying strength despite a recent retreat from the 247.38 resistance level. Momentum remains firmly positive as evidenced by the MACD crossing above its signal line, while the RSI sits comfortably above 50, indicating continued bullish sentiment without entering overbought territory. Volume conditions remain neutral, suggesting the current price action is driven by established trends rather than speculative surges. Price maintains a position above both the 50-day SMA and the VWMA, reinforcing the intermediate-term uptrend, with the 10-day EMA providing additional short-term support. While the MACD histogram demonstrates a slight deceleration in upward momentum, it does not yet warrant a bearish shift. The stock trades within the Bollinger Bands, with ample room for further expansion before encountering the upper band resistance at 249.78. A failure to sustain above the 247.38 mark could trigger a pullback toward the 50-day SMA around 234.04, but the significant downside buffer provided by the lower Bollinger Band and the recent low at 226.19 suggests limited risk. Wait for a pullback to the 240.24 level, coinciding with the 10-day EMA, before considering a re-entry opportunity.
