Technically Bullish, PTT.BK exhibits robust upward momentum supported by rising volume, confirming a strong market sentiment. The price is currently trading near its recent high, comfortably above both the 50-day simple moving average and the 10-day exponential moving average, reinforcing the established bullish trend. The MACD line remains decisively above the signal line, with a positive and expanding histogram, further validating the strengthening uptrend. While the Relative Strength Index registers at 77.62, indicating overbought conditions, the price’s proximity to the upper Bollinger Band, around 33.75, suggests either a continuation of the strong trend or a potential for a short-term consolidation. Key support levels reside around 31.75 and 31.50, while resistance looms at 33.75 and beyond 34.00. Given the prevailing bullish indicators and the volume-weighted moving average supporting the current price action, the actionable setup involves waiting for a minor pullback towards the 31.75 level before considering a re-entry point.
