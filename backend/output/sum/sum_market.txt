Technically bearish, COM7.BK presents a compelling shorting opportunity given the confluence of negative signals across multiple timeframes. The price currently trades below both the 10-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, reinforcing a prevailing downtrend, while the MACD histogram remains firmly negative, confirming waning bullish momentum. Despite a neutral RSI reading at 52.80, the price action has consistently trended downwards over recent months, now residing near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential oversold conditions or a continuation of the established decline. Moderate volatility, as indicated by the ATR of 0.627, adds another layer of risk, and the price’s position below the Volume Weighted Moving Average further validates the bearish sentiment. Immediate support lies around the 20.00 mark, with resistance observed near 20.70, creating a defined trading range. Therefore, the actionable setup involves waiting for a potential pullback towards the 19.60 level before considering an entry point for a short position, anticipating further downside movement.
