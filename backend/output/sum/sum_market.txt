Technically Bullish, BCP.BK demonstrates robust upward momentum fueled by a confluence of positive indicators and rising volume, suggesting sustained buying pressure. The price currently trades comfortably above both the 50-day simple moving average and the 10-day exponential moving average, reinforcing a short-to-medium term bullish trend, while the MACD confirms this strength with a positive reading and histogram. The Relative Strength Index registers at 61.72, indicating strong buying interest without triggering overbought concerns, leaving room for further gains. Price action is nearing the upper Bollinger Band, hinting at potential consolidation or a continuation of the uptrend, with initial support observed around 28.75 and resistance anticipated near 30.00. Given the prevailing bullish sentiment and supportive technical landscape, the actionable setup involves waiting for a minor pullback towards the 28.00 level before considering entry opportunities.
