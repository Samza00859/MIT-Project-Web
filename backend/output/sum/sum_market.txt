Technically bearish, NIO presents a compelling shorting opportunity given the confluence of negative signals across multiple timeframes. Momentum is weak, evidenced by the price trading below both the 50-day simple moving average and the 10-day exponential moving average, reinforcing a short-to-medium term downtrend. The MACD indicator confirms this bearish sentiment, residing below its signal line with a histogram indicating diminishing bearish momentum, though still firmly in negative territory. Relative strength remains subdued at 48.76, lacking robust buying pressure. Price action is currently situated near the lower end of its recent trading range, testing support around the 4.63 level, while facing resistance at approximately 5.61. Volume conditions remain neutral, failing to provide any clear directional confirmation. Given these factors, the actionable setup involves waiting for a potential pullback towards the 5.18 level before considering a short position, anticipating continued downward pressure if key support levels fail to hold.
