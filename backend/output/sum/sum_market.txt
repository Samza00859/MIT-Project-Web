Technically Bullish, KBANK.BK demonstrates a robust long-term uptrend confirmed by its position significantly above both the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, yet momentum indicators reveal a cooling effect as the RSI retreats from overbought conditions and the MACD histogram displays a negative divergence, suggesting waning bullish strength. Volume conditions remain neutral, failing to provide definitive confirmation of the prevailing trend. The price is currently consolidating around 192.5 after a notable rally, finding initial support near 190.5 and facing resistance at 195.5, with the recent high of 197.0 acting as a key barrier. While volatility has moderated, indicated by a decreasing ATR, the flattening 10-day EMA suggests a potential pause in the upward trajectory. Therefore, wait for a decisive breakout above the 195.5 resistance level to confirm renewed bullish momentum before considering an entry, or alternatively, monitor for a pullback to the 190.5 support area for a more favorable risk-reward setup.
