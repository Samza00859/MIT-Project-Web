Technically Bearish, AAPL presents a cautious outlook as of March 13, 2025, with the stock trading below both the 50-day simple moving average and the 10-day exponential moving average, reinforcing a short-term downtrend. Momentum remains weak, evidenced by the MACD's negative reading and declining histogram, though the RSI hovers around neutral territory, suggesting a potential consolidation phase. Volume conditions have been falling, indicating a lack of conviction from both buyers and sellers. Immediate support lies around the 209.68 level, while resistance is capped at approximately 216.98, creating a defined trading range. The price action summary highlights a recent decline, further solidifying the bearish sentiment. Given these factors, the actionable setup involves waiting for a potential breakdown below the 208.42 support level before considering a short position, while closely monitoring the MACD for a bearish crossover that would confirm negative momentum.
