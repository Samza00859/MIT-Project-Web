Technically neutral with a cautious bullish bias, NVDA presents a mixed picture as of January 16, 2026. While the long-term trend remains positive, evidenced by the price trading above the 50-day simple moving average around 184.55, short-term momentum is waning, reflected in the negative MACD histogram and RSI hovering near the midpoint at 51.79. Volume conditions remain neutral, failing to provide a clear indication of impending direction. Price action is currently consolidating in the mid-180s, bounded between approximately 184 and 189, and exhibiting choppy behavior, with key support residing near the VWMA at 185.57 and the lower Bollinger Band around 178.70, while resistance looms just above at 189 and the upper Bollinger Band near 193.29. The decreasing ATR suggests a moderation in volatility, potentially signaling a period of sideways movement. Given the weakening bullish momentum and the price’s proximity to key support and resistance levels, the actionable setup involves waiting for a decisive break above 189 to confirm a renewed upward trajectory, or a pullback to the 184 level to assess potential buying opportunities.
