Technically Bullish, CSCO demonstrates a robust uptrend underpinned by strong momentum and rising volume, positioning it favorably for continued gains. The price currently trades comfortably above both the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, reinforcing the long-term bullish trajectory, while the 10-day exponential moving average provides short-term support. Although the MACD histogram exhibits a slight negative divergence, hinting at a potential momentum slowdown, the overall picture remains constructive, particularly as the Relative Strength Index resides in neutral territory, leaving room for further appreciation. Price action is consolidating near recent highs, testing the upper Bollinger Band resistance around $79.80, with solid support established near $70.00. Given this configuration, the actionable setup involves waiting for a shallow pullback towards the $75.81 level before initiating a long position, anticipating a resumption of the prevailing uptrend.
