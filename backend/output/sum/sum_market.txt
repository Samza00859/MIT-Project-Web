Technically Bearish, NVDA presents a compelling case for continued downside pressure as of December 15, 2025. The stock currently trades below its 50-day simple moving average, reinforcing a medium-term downtrend, while the 10-day exponential moving average acts as near-term resistance. Momentum remains weak, evidenced by the MACD’s persistent negative trajectory and histogram showing only slight improvement, suggesting that bearish sentiment is still dominant. Volume conditions remain neutral, failing to provide any clear indication of a shift in market participation. Despite this short-term weakness, the 200-day simple moving average continues to hold as a significant long-term support level, preventing a complete reversal of the broader uptrend. The Relative Strength Index approaches oversold territory but hasn't reached extremes, leaving room for further declines before a potential bounce. Immediate support lies around $174.82, with further downside potential towards $170 should this level fail, while resistance is observed at $181.31 and the 50-day SMA at $186.84. Given the prevailing bearish signals and the stock’s proximity to key support, the actionable setup involves waiting for a confirmed break below $174.82 before considering a short position, with a stop-loss placed just above this level.
