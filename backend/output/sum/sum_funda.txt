The stock is currently overvalued, as indicated by a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.72, reflecting potentially unsustainable expectations for future growth. Despite this valuation concern, Apple demonstrates exceptional profitability, maintaining a net profit margin of 29.07% while achieving a robust 5.97% year-over-year revenue growth. The company’s ability to generate strong positive and growing free cash flow further supports its financial health and allows for strategic reinvestment and shareholder returns. However, the escalating debt-to-equity ratio of 1.35 presents a notable risk, particularly in a rising interest rate environment, and underscores the need for careful monitoring of leverage levels alongside continued strong performance.
