The stock is currently overvalued, trading at a premium P/E ratio of 36.78, reflecting a valuation that may prove unsustainable given prevailing market conditions. Despite this, Apple exhibits remarkable financial health, underscored by exceptional profitability with a net profit margin of 26.9% and the generation of $98.8 billion in free cash flow, demonstrating efficient capital utilization and robust operational execution as evidenced by a staggering return on equity of 151.9%. However, a concerning debt-to-equity ratio of 3.87 introduces significant leverage risk, potentially exposing the company to vulnerabilities during economic downturns or periods of rising interest rates, which warrants careful monitoring.
