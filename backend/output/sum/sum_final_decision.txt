**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a FULL SELL position.

The decision to liquidate our existing position stems from persistent systemic geopolitical risks, particularly concerning Tencent’s vulnerability to US-China relations despite innovative workarounds, coupled with consistently bearish technical indicators signaling further potential declines toward the 602.00 support level. Given the lack of crucial valuation data, any bullish outlook remains speculative and unacceptable given the current risk profile. To safeguard capital, we will immediately execute a full sell of all positions, maintaining a strict hard stop loss at the prevailing market price to mitigate potential downside. A re-evaluation of investment will only occur upon a substantial and sustained de-escalation of US-China tensions, evidenced by a genuine alleviation of the chip supply vulnerability, alongside a decisive reversal in technical indicators—specifically, a break and hold above key moving averages and established resistance levels—and the availability of comprehensive valuation data demonstrating compelling undervaluation. The critical invalidating condition for this decision is a sudden and unexpected improvement in US-China relations, accompanied by a significant and sustained upward trend in technical indicators, which would necessitate a reassessment of the risk-reward balance.
