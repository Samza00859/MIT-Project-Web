**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a full exit of the existing position. The portfolio manager’s recommendation to sell stems from a confluence of factors indicating substantial overvaluation and heightened risk exposure. A Price-to-Earnings ratio exceeding 36.62, coupled with escalating regulatory challenges in key markets like Italy and Brazil, presents an unsustainable financial profile. Technical indicators further reinforce this assessment, with an RSI of 83.25 signaling extreme overbought conditions and price stagnation at a critical resistance level. While acknowledging the potential for future growth driven by AI advancements, the immediate priority is to safeguard capital against a likely corrective pullback towards the 236.18 VWMA support. To mitigate execution risk, a full market sell is advised, with a limit order placed slightly below the current price as a contingency for a gap-down opening. Re-evaluation for a potential re-entry will only occur after a healthy consolidation, resolution of regulatory concerns, and a return to neutral RSI levels. The critical invalidating condition for this decision is a sustained rally above the 247.10 resistance, which would necessitate a reassessment of the underlying valuation and risk profile.
