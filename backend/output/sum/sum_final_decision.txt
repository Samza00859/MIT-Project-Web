**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a Long position in Nvidia, contingent upon strict adherence to the outlined execution plan. The decision acknowledges Nvidia’s robust financial history and potential for continued AI leadership, despite temporary headwinds stemming from geopolitical factors. While concerns regarding a direct blockade and technical indicators warrant caution, a strategic compromise is deemed appropriate, informed by past trading errors that highlight the perils of inaction or unchecked aggression. To mitigate immediate risks, a reduced core position of 25-33% will be initiated within the range of $178-$193, accompanied by a hard stop loss at $177.70. The remaining 67-75% of the intended allocation will be deferred until a decisive daily close above the $193.29 resistance level confirms market acceptance of the current challenges. This phased approach balances exposure to Nvidia’s long-term prospects with rigorous risk management, with the critical invalidating condition being a breach of the $177.70 stop loss, triggering an immediate exit to preserve capital.
