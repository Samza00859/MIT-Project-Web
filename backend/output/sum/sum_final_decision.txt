**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a scaled long position in NVIDIA.

The decision acknowledges a compelling long-term investment thesis driven by exceptional revenue growth and surging AI demand, tempered by immediate bearish technical indicators suggesting potential short-term volatility. To mitigate this risk, a refined trader plan has been developed, initiating with a 50% position entry at current levels between $174.80 and $175, protected by a tight stop-loss at $174.50. Conviction in the underlying fundamentals remains high, but capital preservation is prioritized through a staged approach; the remaining 50% of the intended position will only be deployed following a confirmed bullish reversal signaled by a break above the 10-period EMA on increasing volume, with a final stop-loss set at the 200-day SMA of $156.32 once both entries are filled. The critical invalidating condition for this trade is a breach of the initial stop-loss at $174.50, triggering a full exit and reassessment of the investment thesis.
