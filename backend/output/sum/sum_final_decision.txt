**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a SELL position.

The decision to sell PTT Public Company Limited shares stems from a confluence of factors indicating heightened near-term risk. While fundamental analysis reveals underlying strengths, prevailing technical indicators—specifically, an RSI exceeding 70 and pricing at the upper Bollinger Band—signal a significant overbought condition and elevated probability of a price correction. This technical vulnerability is compounded by PTT’s considerable debt burden within a cyclical energy sector, particularly concerning given persistent inflationary pressures and geopolitical instability. To mitigate immediate downside risk and prioritize capital preservation, a full liquidation of the existing position is warranted. The execution will proceed immediately, with continuous monitoring of global commodity prices, interest rates, and PTT’s debt sustainability. A hard stop loss will not be implemented, but re-evaluation for potential re-entry will only occur following a substantial price correction and stabilization of technical indicators. The critical invalidating condition for this trade is a sustained upward trend defying technical oversold signals, suggesting a fundamental shift requiring immediate reassessment of the risk profile.
