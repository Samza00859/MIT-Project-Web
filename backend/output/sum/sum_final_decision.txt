**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a reduced exposure SELL position. The decision stems from concerning technical indicators – specifically, a declining MACD histogram and repeated failure to breach the 188.85 resistance – coupled with a fundamentally stretched valuation reflected in a high P/E ratio of 44, leaving limited buffer against potential headwinds such as Chinese export restrictions. While acknowledging the opportunity cost of immediate gains, the analysts’ consensus favors mitigating downside risk, particularly given past experiences where disregarding technical signals in overvalued assets resulted in losses. To execute this strategy safely, the position size will be significantly reduced, with priority given to sales during any price rallies approaching the 189 resistance. A hard stop loss will be implemented at 184.55 to limit potential losses should support fail, and re-entry will only be considered upon a confirmed breakout above 189 accompanied by increased volume or a substantial washout to stronger support levels around 178. The critical invalidating condition for this trade is a sustained break below 184.55, triggering immediate liquidation to prevent further losses.
