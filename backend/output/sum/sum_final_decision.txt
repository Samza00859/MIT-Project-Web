**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a Long position.

The decision to proceed with a buy recommendation is predicated on a favorable long-term outlook supported by robust fundamentals and a sustained price position above the 200-day Simple Moving Average, balanced against acknowledged short-term volatility. To mitigate immediate risks signaled by bearish technical indicators, a scaled entry approach will be implemented, initiating a 50% position at the current level near the 50-day SMA support of $674.79, protected by a hard stop-loss at $672.00. A target profit-taking level is set at the Bollinger Upper Band of $697.69. The remaining 50% of the intended position will be deployed only upon a decisive daily close above the 10-day Exponential Moving Average, confirming a recovery in momentum. Our conviction level is moderate, contingent on diligent monitoring; a breach below the 50-day SMA will serve as the critical invalidating condition, triggering a full exit from the position.
