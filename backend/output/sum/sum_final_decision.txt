**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a partial long position.

The decision to initiate a partial long position reflects a balanced assessment of both upside potential and immediate technical risks. While the underlying fundamentals remain strongly bullish, supported by positive analyst targets and technological advancements, recent momentum indicators warrant caution. To mitigate these concerns, we will execute a phased entry strategy, beginning with a limited position near $268, protected by a hard stop-loss at $267. Capital will be reserved to strategically average down should the price stabilize, indicated by a reclaim of the 10-day EMA or flattening of the MACD histogram. Our conviction level is moderate, contingent upon closely monitoring technical signals and avoiding a sustained breakdown below the $268 support level, which would serve as the critical invalidating condition, triggering an immediate exit to preserve capital.
