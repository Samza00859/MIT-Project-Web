**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a SELL position, prioritizing capital preservation amidst elevated risk. The decision is supported by converging technical indicators—a decelerating momentum profile evidenced by a negative MACD histogram and crossover, price action nearing the Bollinger Upper Band, and an RSI approaching overbought territory—signaling a potential correction following a substantial parabolic rally. While acknowledging the Risky Analyst’s AI narrative, the prevailing consensus from the Safe and Neutral Analysts underscores the immediate downside risk to established support levels, particularly the 50-day Simple Moving Average at $71.46. To mitigate potential losses, execution will be contingent upon current market strength or a test of $79.79, with a mandatory hard stop-loss implemented at $74.89, aligned with the Bollinger Middle Band. A defensive stance will be maintained, monitoring for stabilization and a potential re-entry opportunity should technical conditions improve; however, a sustained breach below $71.46 would invalidate the current outlook and necessitate a reassessment of the position.
