**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a FULL SELL position.

The decision to liquidate our holdings in PTT Public Company Limited stems from a confluence of concerning technical and macroeconomic indicators signaling imminent downside risk. Current technical analysis reveals a state of severe overextension, with the Relative Strength Index exceeding 77 and the price consistently trading above the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting a likely correction. This assessment is further compounded by a deteriorating global economic landscape characterized by escalating trade tensions and geopolitical instability, creating substantial headwinds for energy and petrochemical companies. While acknowledging PTT’s robust fundamentals and strategic LNG agreement, the immediate threat of market volatility necessitates a proactive approach to capital preservation. To mitigate potential losses, a full sell order will be executed immediately, with a hard stop loss set around 31.50 to safeguard against unforeseen declines. Re-evaluation for a potential re-entry will only occur once global trade tensions demonstrably subside, allowing for a more risk-adjusted opportunity. The critical invalidating condition for this decision is a sustained period of improved global trade relations and geopolitical stability, indicating a shift away from the current risk-off sentiment.
