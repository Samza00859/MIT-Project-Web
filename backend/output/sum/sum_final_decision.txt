**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a decisive SELL.

The recommendation to liquidate all existing positions stems from a compelling convergence of bearish technical indicators, corroborated by rigorous risk analysis. While the company demonstrates underlying fundamental strength—including robust revenue growth and return on equity—these positives are presently overshadowed by a pronounced negative trend across multiple technical metrics. The immediate priority is capital preservation, as attempting to navigate a declining asset through reduced positions or tight stop-losses represents an unwarranted gamble against prevailing market forces. To mitigate potential losses, the approved action involves an immediate and complete exit from the position, with a mandatory position size reflecting full liquidation. A hard stop-loss will not be implemented, as the strategy prioritizes a clean exit rather than attempting to capture a potentially fleeting rebound. Future re-entry will only be considered upon a demonstrable and sustained reversal in technical indicators, signaling a shift in market sentiment and a reduction in inventory risk. The critical invalidating condition for this decision is a failure to execute the full liquidation within the next trading session, which would necessitate an immediate review and potential escalation to senior management due to heightened risk exposure.
