**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a Long position, contingent upon strict adherence to outlined risk mitigation strategies.

The decision to transition from a Hold to a Cautious Buy reflects a calculated acceptance of inherent market volatility, balanced against compelling fundamental drivers. While technical indicators currently suggest short-term bearish momentum, the company’s recent actions—specifically, a substantial share buyback signaling management’s confidence and a strategic acquisition of advanced AI chips—provide a strong foundation for long-term value appreciation. Recognizing the potential for a rapid sell-off, we will initiate a reduced position size, approximately 25-50% of the intended full allocation, to mitigate downside risk. A dynamic stop-loss order will be implemented just below the critical support levels of 610.00 and 602.24, ensuring capital preservation should adverse technical trends persist. Continuous monitoring of these support levels, geopolitical factors impacting technology supply chains, and emerging valuation clarity will be paramount. Our conviction level is moderate, acknowledging the existing technical headwinds but bolstered by the proactive steps taken by management and the company’s robust financial performance. The critical invalidating condition for this trade is a breach of the 602.24 support level, triggering immediate liquidation to prevent further losses.
