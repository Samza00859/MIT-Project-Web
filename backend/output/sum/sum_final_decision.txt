**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a SELL position.

The decision to execute a preemptive sell order stems from a confluence of concerning technical indicators and fundamental vulnerabilities outweighing potential upside catalysts. While acknowledging the bullish perspective presented by the Risky analyst, the Safe analyst’s warning of a potential breakdown, supported by negative MACD and declining volume, necessitates immediate action to mitigate downside risk. The stock’s elevated leverage and exposure to a slowing domestic economy further amplify these concerns, making the current price action at the 190.5 support level an unfavorable risk-reward scenario. A market-price execution is authorized, with no new positions to be initiated until a clear reversal of the bearish technical structure occurs, such as a confirmed reclaim of the 190.5 level with bullish volume confirmation, or a demonstrable improvement in the fundamental outlook. Key risks to monitor include a reversal in Thai Baht strength and shifts in global risk sentiment. This conservative approach prioritizes capital preservation and maintains a conviction level of 85%, contingent upon continuous monitoring for invalidating conditions – specifically, a sustained breach above the 190.5 resistance level accompanied by increasing volume, signaling a resumption of the prior upward trend.
