Trade APPROVED for a Long position in Apple (AAPL), predicated on a robust bullish thesis reinforced by multiple analyst perspectives and underpinned by the company’s strong financial fundamentals. While acknowledging valid concerns regarding technical distribution and regulatory headwinds, these risks are deemed manageable through prudent risk controls. The asymmetric upside potential, with analyst targets reaching $315, significantly outweighs short-term vulnerabilities when approached strategically. To mitigate downside exposure, a moderate initial position size of 60-70% of full allocation will be implemented, with an urgent buy target around $270 and a hard stop-loss placed at $269.00, just below the Bollinger lower band, providing a defined exit point should support fail. Further opportunities for incremental additions may arise if the price retraces to $266.25. Profit targets are initially set at $274 and $278, with a longer-term holding strategy contingent upon successful AI monetization and sustained iPhone demand. The critical invalidating condition for this trade remains a breach of the $269.00 stop-loss, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment and requiring immediate action to protect capital.
