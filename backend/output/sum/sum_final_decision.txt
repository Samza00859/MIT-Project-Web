**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for maintaining the existing long position in Amazon.

The decision to hold stems from a careful assessment of conflicting analyses; while the Risky Analyst highlights robust fundamentals and AI growth potential, the Safe Analyst identifies immediate technical headwinds suggesting a potential pullback. Acknowledging these opposing viewpoints, the Neutral Analyst’s balanced perspective underscores that the current price point presents suboptimal risk-adjusted entry. To mitigate near-term volatility, a tight protective stop-loss will be implemented below the 10-day Exponential Moving Average at 240, safeguarding against substantial drawdowns. New capital deployment will be contingent upon either a pullback to the 234 support level, aligning with the 50-day Simple Moving Average, or a decisive breakout above the 247.38 resistance accompanied by strong volume, ensuring a more favorable risk profile. Position sizing will remain conservative to address regulatory and competitive pressures. The critical invalidating condition for this strategy is a sustained breach below the 234 support level, signaling a potential shift in the prevailing bullish trend and necessitating a reevaluation of the position.
