**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for an immediate SELL position. The prevailing analysis underscores a significant risk exposure stemming from a pronounced disconnect between the company’s exceptionally high Price-to-Earnings ratio of 62.5 and an alarmingly low Net Profit Margin of 0.73 percent, indicating an unsustainable valuation fueled by speculative market sentiment rather than underlying profitability. While acknowledging current bullish technicals and a supportive macro environment, the consensus view—supported by both Safe and Neutral analysts—is that these short-term factors do not adequately mitigate the inherent fundamental weakness. To manage this risk, the position size will be limited to 2% of total portfolio value, with a hard stop loss set at 5% below the current market price to safeguard against unexpected volatility. Entry will be executed immediately at the prevailing market rate. The critical invalidating condition for this decision would be a substantial and sustained improvement in the company’s Net Profit Margin, signaling a fundamental shift in operational efficiency and earnings power, which would warrant a re-evaluation of the current position.
