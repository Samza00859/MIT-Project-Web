**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for an immediate and full SELL position. The decision stems from a confluence of severe financial distress indicators and compelling bearish technical signals, presenting an unacceptable risk profile for capital preservation. The company’s persistent net losses, declining free cash flow, and highly leveraged balance sheet demonstrate a fundamental inability to sustain operations, outweighing any potential upside driven by recent revenue growth. Technical analysis further reinforces the need for an exit, with the approaching “death cross” and price action consistently below key moving averages signaling substantial downside risk. To mitigate potential losses, a hard stop-loss will be closely monitored at the 4.63 support level, with re-evaluation for a potential re-entry contingent upon demonstrable and sustained improvements in financial performance and a confirmed reversal of current technical trends. The critical invalidating condition for this trade remains the failure to observe a clear and credible path toward profitability and positive free cash flow, alongside a confirmed shift in technical momentum.
