**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a SELL position.

The decision to execute a complete sell order for ADVANC.BK stems from a heightened assessment of near-term technical risk, prioritizing capital preservation above potential upside gains. Overwhelmingly strong technical indicators, including an RSI of 82.29 and proximity to the upper Bollinger Band, signal an imminent price correction, presenting a significant vulnerability to a sharp pullback. While the company demonstrates robust fundamentals—accelerated revenue growth and consistent free cash flow—these strengths do not mitigate the immediate technical risks. A high debt-to-equity ratio of 2.20 further amplifies sensitivity to macroeconomic headwinds, potentially exacerbating any corrective action. Our conviction level is high, reflecting the consensus among analysts regarding the overextended valuation and the potential for a rapid reversal. To manage this risk, the entire position should be liquidated immediately, with a re-entry strategy contingent upon a substantial correction and stabilization of technical indicators, specifically targeting support levels around 338.00 or 332.00. Continuous monitoring of fundamental performance and global economic conditions is essential. The critical invalidating condition for this decision would be a sustained breach above the recent high, indicating a rejection of the anticipated correction and a potential continuation of the upward trend, necessitating a reassessment of the risk profile.
