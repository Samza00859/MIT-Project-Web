**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a full SELL position. The decision to divest from NVIDIA stems from a confluence of escalating regulatory risks, specifically the confirmed restriction on H200 chips for China, which directly threatens a substantial revenue stream. This concern is amplified by the stock’s exceptionally high valuation—a Price to Earnings Ratio of 45.89—leaving limited buffer against potential corrections. Technical indicators further reinforce this vulnerability, with a bearish MACD signal and the looming possibility of breaching critical support levels. While acknowledging NVIDIA’s dominance in the AI sector, the prevailing risks outweigh the anticipated upside, demanding a proactive approach to capital preservation. The execution will involve an immediate full liquidation of the existing position, with no designated entry zone for re-entry until a demonstrable stabilization of U.S. export regulations and a more reasonable valuation emerge. The critical invalidating condition for this decision is any indication of a swift reversal of the H200 chip restrictions or a significant shift in geopolitical tensions that demonstrably alleviates the current operational headwinds.
