**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a long position in Amazon, contingent upon strict adherence to outlined risk mitigation strategies. The decision reflects a tempered bullish outlook, acknowledging both the compelling fundamental drivers—particularly AWS margin expansion and robust net income—and potential short-term headwinds indicated by waning momentum signals. A conviction level of moderate is assigned, predicated on a balanced approach that prioritizes disciplined risk management over aggressive leverage. To ensure prudent execution, the initial position will be limited to 50-70% of allocated capital, establishing a hard stop-loss at $232.79 to safeguard against technical breakdowns. Entry will be at current levels, with consideration for averaging down within the $232 support zone should the stock hold, while maintaining the stop-loss. Further accumulation is authorized upon a decisive breach of the $246.29 resistance, targeting the November high of $250.20. The critical invalidating condition remains continuous monitoring of AWS margin reports and regulatory developments; any material adverse change warrants immediate reevaluation and potential position adjustment.
