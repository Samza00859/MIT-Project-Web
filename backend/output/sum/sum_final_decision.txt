**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for maintaining the current long position in PTT Public Company Limited.

The decision to hold reflects a balanced assessment of the company’s robust revenue growth and positive free cash flow against considerable downside risks stemming from volatile commodity prices and potential regulatory changes. While the stock is currently fairly valued with neutral technical indicators, the underlying fundamentals warrant continued investment, demanding a prudent approach that avoids speculative overcommitment or premature capitulation. To mitigate risk, the position size will remain consistent with current holdings, with a hard stop loss implemented at 30.68 to protect against significant downside volatility. A modest increase in exposure will only be considered upon a decisive upward breakout above the upper Bollinger Band, accompanied by increasing volume, signaling a clear shift in positive momentum. The critical invalidating condition for this strategy is a sustained decline in global commodity prices coupled with unfavorable regulatory developments, triggering an immediate review and potential reduction of the position to safeguard capital.
