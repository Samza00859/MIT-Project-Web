Trade APPROVED for a Long position in NVIDIA, acknowledging near-term volatility but underpinned by the company’s exceptional financial strength and dominant position within the AI hardware and software landscape. While concerns regarding valuation—specifically the elevated P/E ratio—and potential technical setbacks were raised, the conviction rests on NVIDIA’s insurmountable multi-year lead and expanding total addressable market, justifying acceptance of tactical risks. To mitigate these concerns, a scaled entry strategy will be employed, allocating an initial 50% position near current support around $178, protected by a hard stop-loss at $173 to limit potential downside. The remaining 50% will be reserved for a confirmed bullish reversal signal—a daily close above the 10-day Exponential Moving Average with increasing volume—allowing for opportunistic entry. Continuous monitoring of NVIDIA’s growth trajectory and margins is paramount; any indication of deceleration or compression warrants an immediate review and potential adjustment to the position. Failure to maintain robust growth and margin performance, signaling a weakening of NVIDIA’s competitive advantage, constitutes the critical invalidating condition.
