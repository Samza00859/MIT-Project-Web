**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a revised HOLD position in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), contingent upon stringent risk mitigation measures.

The decision to HOLD reflects a balanced assessment of AMD’s complex risk-reward profile, acknowledging both its compelling growth trajectory and inherent valuation fragility. While initial plans for an immediate sell were deemed overly absolute, the potential for continued upside driven by AI product launches and robust revenue growth warrants maintaining exposure. However, the elevated P/E ratio of 116.3 and emerging US tariffs on AI chips present significant downside risks that necessitate a proactive risk management strategy. Conviction level is moderate, requiring constant vigilance and adaptability.

To execute this strategy safely, the current position will be reduced to a smaller allocation, with an immediate partial sale to lower overall capital at risk. A tight stop-loss order will be implemented below key support levels, providing a clear exit point should the stock experience a sharp reversal. Furthermore, resistance levels will be closely monitored, with consideration for further position reduction if those levels are not convincingly breached. Conditional accumulation may be considered if the stock pulls back to established support levels and the fundamental outlook stabilizes. Continuous monitoring of tariff impacts, AI demand, and competitive pressures is paramount.

The Critical Invalidating Condition for this trade is a decisive breach of the established stop-loss level or a significant deterioration in the fundamental outlook regarding AI chip demand or tariff enforcement, triggering an immediate and complete exit from the position.
