**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a Long position in Nvidia, contingent upon adherence to the refined execution plan. The recommendation stems from compelling fundamental analysis indicating Nvidia’s dominant position within the burgeoning AI landscape, supported by robust revenue growth and profitability. While acknowledging short-term technical headwinds highlighted by cautionary analysts, a scaled entry strategy mitigates immediate downside risk, balancing aggressive participation in the AI super-cycle with prudent capital preservation. Initial investment will be limited to 30-40% of the intended allocation, with a hard stop loss set at $165.00 to safeguard against a cascading breach. Subsequent capital will be deployed upon a daily close above the 10-day EMA, signaling technical stabilization. Continuous monitoring of valuation metrics and regulatory developments remains crucial, but the core thesis of Nvidia’s enduring ecosystem moat warrants this measured approach. The critical invalidating condition is a sustained break below $165.00, triggering immediate liquidation to protect against unforeseen market shifts.
