**Final Risk Verdict: Trade APPROVED for a SELL position.** The decision to execute an immediate sell order stems from a confluence of concerning technical and fundamental indicators, strongly suggesting accelerated downside momentum and heightened risk exposure. Confirmed bearish signals—including a MACD crossover, price below key moving averages, and fundamental overvaluation—are compounded by escalating regulatory pressures threatening Apple’s core revenue streams. While acknowledging potential future catalysts, the prevailing analysis underscores the urgency of risk mitigation, particularly given historical losses incurred during similar market breakdowns. To safeguard capital, the trade will be executed immediately, targeting avoidance of a breakdown below the $269 support level, with a hard stop-loss set at $271 should the sale not occur. Reassessment for re-entry will only be considered following a technical recovery above the 10 EMA and resolution of the regulatory overhang, with a focus on AI catalyst developments. The critical invalidating condition for this trade is a breach below $269, which would necessitate immediate reassessment and potential further downside protection measures.
