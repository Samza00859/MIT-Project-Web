**Final Risk Verdict:** Trade APPROVED for a Long position in NVIDIA.

The decision to proceed rests on a robust bullish thesis underpinned by NVIDIA’s dominant market position, strong financial performance—demonstrated by a 91.9% Return on Equity and substantial free cash flow—and the anticipated H200 shipment catalyst in February 2026. While acknowledging the immediate technical risk of the current price nearing upper Bollinger Band resistance, a carefully calibrated approach mitigates potential downside. The refined trader plan involves a two-stage scaled entry, initiating a 30-40% starter position on a pullback to the $182-$185 support zone, protected by an initial stop-loss at $179.50. Subsequent allocation will be added upon a confirmed breakout above $190, adjusting the overall stop-loss to breakeven. Continuous monitoring of potential P/E compression remains paramount. This strategy balances momentum conviction with prudent risk management, ensuring a favorable risk-adjusted entry and participation in the expected catalyst-driven upside. The critical invalidating condition is a sustained breach below $179.50, triggering immediate exit from the starter position and reevaluation of the overall thesis.
