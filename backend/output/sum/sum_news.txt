News sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish regarding Nvidia, fueled by the anticipated reopening of the Chinese AI chip market and recent endorsements from major financial institutions like Morgan Stanley. A pivotal development is the US government’s approval of H200 AI chip exports to China, slated to begin in mid-February 2026, potentially unlocking billions in revenue and offsetting existing trade tensions. Analysts at Raymond James project substantial upside for both Nvidia and AMD, with AMD potentially realizing $500-$800 million in additional revenue. Alibaba’s emergence as a key player further underscores China’s growing AI sector and its significance for US chipmakers. Despite this positive outlook, geopolitical uncertainties surrounding US-China trade relations pose a risk to the export timeline and revenue projections. Intensifying competition from AMD’s MI308 chip and Google’s AI hardware advancements also threaten Nvidia’s market share, while valuation concerns remain given the company’s premium multiples. Overall, expect continued investor enthusiasm and potential price appreciation leading up to the February 2026 export commencement, though volatility may arise from macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures.
