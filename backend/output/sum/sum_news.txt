News sentiment is cautiously neutral, reflecting a market relieved by President Trump’s reversal of tariff threats against Greenland, which spurred a rally across European and Asian markets. However, this optimism is tempered by persistent concerns regarding global economic fragility, exemplified by South Korea’s unexpected contraction—a signal that could ripple through international trade and investment. Simultaneously, Southeast Asia’s rising coal demand presents a conflicting trend, potentially hindering the region’s transition towards renewable energy sources and creating uncertainty within the energy sector. Regarding Advanced Info Service PCL (ADVANC.BK), recent big lot trading activity suggests institutional interest, though it does not fundamentally alter the company’s outlook. The primary risk remains the potential for renewed geopolitical instability and the possibility of further regional economic downturns, which could quickly erode the current market gains. Expect continued volatility as investors weigh these competing forces and assess the long-term sustainability of the current recovery.
