News sentiment is cautiously neutral, reflecting a dynamic shift in global investment strategies amidst ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. A growing number of investors are pivoting towards Chinese AI assets as concerns arise regarding inflated valuations in the US tech sector, signaling a potential realignment of capital flows. This movement is further underscored by Tencent's strategic maneuvering, successfully accessing banned Nvidia Blackwell chips through Japanese cloud services, bolstering its AI capabilities and competitive standing. While this access provides a significant advantage, it also highlights the complexities introduced by geopolitical tensions and potential trade restrictions that could disrupt technology supply chains. Tencent’s recent substantial share buyback reinforces management’s confidence in the company’s long-term prospects, yet the intensifying competition within the AI landscape necessitates continued innovation and substantial investment to maintain market share. Overall, expect continued volatility as the AI race accelerates and market participants navigate the interplay of technological advancements, regulatory hurdles, and evolving geopolitical dynamics.
