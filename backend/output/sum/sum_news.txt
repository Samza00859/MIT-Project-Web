News sentiment surrounding Apple remains cautiously neutral as analysts issue upward revisions to price targets, citing robust iPhone demand and promising advancements in artificial intelligence capabilities. Morgan Stanley and Jefferies have notably increased their targets to $315 and $283.36 respectively, fueled by expectations of continued pricing power and the potential introduction of AI-powered smart glasses and camera-equipped AirPods by 2026. However, these positive signals are tempered by escalating regulatory scrutiny, particularly following an $115 million antitrust fine levied in Italy over its App Tracking Transparency policy. This action underscores broader concerns regarding the App Store’s revenue model and the potential for increased compliance costs across Europe and Asia. Furthermore, a former Met Chief's call for Apple and Google to disable stolen phones adds another layer of regulatory pressure concerning device security. With a valuation of 36 times earnings, Apple faces vulnerability should iPhone demand falter or AI monetization prove less impactful than anticipated, alongside potential margin compression stemming from rising memory prices. Expect volatility ahead of further regulatory rulings and as the market assesses the viability of Apple’s ambitious AI wearable strategy.
