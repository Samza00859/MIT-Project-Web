News sentiment is currently negative, reflecting widespread concern over escalating trade war fears and heightened geopolitical tensions. The dominant narrative centers on the United States’ aggressive trade stance, particularly its threats of tariffs against European allies related to the ongoing Greenland dispute, which has the potential to disrupt over $1 trillion in trade volume. This uncertainty is triggering a broad market sell-off, as investors rapidly shift towards safe-haven assets like gold, evidenced by a significant surge in its price. Corporate earnings are being overshadowed by these macroeconomic anxieties, with consumer behavior already impacted as seen by Amazon shoppers opting for cheaper brands due to rising prices caused by tariffs. The Treasury market is experiencing considerable volatility, reflecting deep investor apprehension about potential economic fallout and increased borrowing costs. While a strategic partnership between Thailand’s PTT and Glenfarne for an Alaska LNG project offers a positive development, it is unlikely to offset the prevailing bearish sentiment. Expect continued market volatility and potential disruptions to international supply chains as trade tensions persist and geopolitical risks remain elevated.
