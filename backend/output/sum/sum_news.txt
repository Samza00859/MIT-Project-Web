News sentiment is overwhelmingly positive regarding Tencent, fueled by strategic maneuvers and robust financial performance. The company is successfully navigating US export restrictions by accessing Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips through Japanese cloud services, demonstrating remarkable adaptability in the face of geopolitical tensions. This access, alongside strong results in core gaming and cloud businesses, underscores Tencent’s continued growth trajectory and potential for upside. Technical indicators further support this bullish outlook, with the stock price trading above key moving averages and a substantial share buyback program signaling management’s confidence in the company’s valuation. Record video game sales in China, coupled with overseas expansion and AI investments, contribute to the positive sentiment surrounding the gaming sector. While risks remain, including potential further restrictions on technology access and execution challenges in AI integration, recent policy shifts in China suggest a more supportive regulatory environment. Consequently, expect continued positive momentum for Tencent, albeit with inherent volatility stemming from the complex interplay of global trade dynamics and technological advancements.
