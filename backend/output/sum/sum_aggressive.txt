**The Aggressive view strongly advocates for immediate and substantial accumulation of this asset, dismissing current market anxieties as fleeting distractions obscuring a profound opportunity.** A temporary regulatory overhang has triggered a technical pullback, but this represents a contrarian inflection point where patient investors can seize control. The underlying fundamentals remain exceptionally robust, anchored by a steadfast position above the 200-day moving average and fortified by a critical support confluence at $268. The potential for a FOMO-driven squeeze is palpable, fueled by escalating institutional accumulation evidenced in options activity and amplified by Morgan Stanley’s ambitious $315 price target—a potential 15%+ upside swing. This transition from perceived AI laggard to frontrunner with the anticipated Siri 2.0 release will catalyze a significant re-rating, while ongoing buybacks and a remarkable 151.9% return on equity establish a powerful floor. The critical trigger for realizing this asymmetric reward lies in the decisive confirmation of the AI upgrade, which will unleash a wave of positive sentiment and propel the price towards its full potential.
