**The Aggressive view strongly advocates for immediate and decisive accumulation of Amazon shares, dismissing current market hesitation as a surrender of substantial upside.** Sentiment surrounding Amazon's AI capabilities, particularly within AWS, is rapidly intensifying, fueled by projections of a significant surge by 2026, creating a potent FOMO dynamic. The company’s robust financial performance—a staggering $59 billion in earnings coupled with unparalleled cash flow—demonstrates an underlying strength that dwarfs short-term regulatory concerns and minor technical resistance. This isn't a consolidation; it's a coiled spring, exhibiting powerful momentum across all key indicators, primed for a breakout beyond the 247.38 level. Ignoring this opportunity, waiting for a pullback, is conceding potential gains to those less willing to embrace volatility. A swift move above this critical resistance will validate the thesis and unlock a considerable asymmetric reward, solidifying Amazon’s position as a dominant force in both e-commerce and cloud computing.
