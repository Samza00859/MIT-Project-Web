**The Aggressive view strongly advocates for immediate and leveraged accumulation of KBANK, dismissing current market hesitation as a fleeting opportunity.** A robust, undeniable uptrend remains firmly intact, bolstered by the Thai Baht's unprecedented strength which is actively channeling substantial foreign capital into Thai equities – a tangible, ongoing catalyst ignored by cautious observers. While momentum has moderated, this represents a strategic digestion period, setting the stage for a significant upward surge fueled by FOMO and potential short squeezes as the market recognizes the underlying force driving inflows. Holding above crucial volume-weighted support, coupled with a fortress-like balance sheet, positions KBANK for an asymmetric reward profile, offering a clear path towards the 200 resistance level. The critical trigger for realizing this high-upside play is sustained foreign exchange stability, validating the current capital flows and unleashing the full potential of this undervalued asset.
