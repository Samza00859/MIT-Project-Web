**The Aggressive view strongly advocates for immediate and substantial positioning in PTT Public Company Limited, dismissing concerns about short-term technical indicators as noise obscuring a powerful, sustained uptrend.** The market’s bullish momentum, confirmed by key moving average crossovers and a positive MACD, coupled with the company’s exceptional free cash flow and robust revenue generation, creates a compelling case for aggressive accumulation. Ignoring the elevated RSI and Bollinger Bands represents a failure to recognize the current environment – one driven by FOMO and primed for a potential squeeze as institutional investors catch up to the rapid price appreciation. This is a contrarian opportunity to capitalize on the fear of missing out, anticipating a significant asymmetric reward as the favorable macroeconomic conditions and PTT’s intrinsic value drive further expansion. The critical trigger for realizing this high-risk, high-reward play is a decisive break above the recent resistance level, signaling a continuation of the upward trajectory and validating the aggressive stance.
