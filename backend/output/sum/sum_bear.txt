The asset is critically overvalued due to a disconnect between perceived fundamental strength and deteriorating market sentiment, presenting a compelling shorting opportunity. Despite claims of underlying resilience, technical indicators paint a concerning picture of ongoing downward pressure and a distinct lack of investor conviction. The stock’s current trading below both the 50-day and 10-day moving averages, confirmed by a bearish MACD crossover, signals a sustained negative trend, suggesting that investors are already discounting future prospects. Compounding this technical weakness is the company’s substantial inventory levels, exceeding 12 billion Thai Baht, which pose a significant risk if consumer demand softens or technological shifts occur, potentially forcing costly markdowns. Given the confluence of these factors—the bearish technical setup, the elevated inventory risk, and the vulnerability to economic downturns—we project a downside target of 25% from current levels, making COM7.BK an unattractive investment and warranting immediate position reduction to mitigate further losses.
