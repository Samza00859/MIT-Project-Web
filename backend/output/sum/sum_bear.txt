The asset is critically overvalued due to an unwarranted assumption of perpetual high growth and margin expansion, evidenced by its demanding Price-to-Earnings ratio of 34.86, a multiple that fails to account for the escalating headwinds confronting the business. While bulls selectively highlight minor technical consolidations, a closer examination reveals a concerning pattern of exhaustion: waning bullish momentum indicated by the declining Moving Average Convergence Divergence histogram, a definitive bearish rejection at the 247.38 resistance level, and a Relative Strength Index suggesting imminent pullback potential. These technical warning signs, coupled with fundamental vulnerabilities—including intensifying retail competition, regulatory pressures across multiple jurisdictions, and a substantial $83 billion capital expenditure plan that strains free cash flow—paint a picture of significant downside risk. The confluence of these factors suggests a near-term correction towards the 234 support level is highly probable, representing a potential 5% drop from current levels, and a deeper correction is possible should macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or regulatory challenges intensify. Prudent investors should reduce exposure or avoid the stock altogether, awaiting a more compelling risk-reward entry point following a meaningful correction.
