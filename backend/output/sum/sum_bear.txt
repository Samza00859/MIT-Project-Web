The asset is critically overvalued due to a precarious balance sheet and unsustainable technical momentum, presenting a compelling short opportunity. Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited (ADVANC.BK) exhibits a concerning debt-to-equity ratio of 2.20, magnifying its vulnerability to rising interest rates and macroeconomic headwinds like the recent contraction in South Korea, which threatens regional demand. While past performance has been robust, the current valuation ignores the inherent risks associated with servicing such a substantial debt load, particularly given the capital-intensive nature of its operations. Technically, the stock’s Relative Strength Index sits at an alarming 82.29, firmly in overbought territory, alongside trading near the upper Bollinger Band, signaling an imminent correction. Increasing volume accompanying this rally raises suspicion of large holders exiting positions, rather than sustained institutional support. We anticipate a significant reversal, targeting a potential downside of 15-20% as the market recognizes the fundamental and technical vulnerabilities plaguing ADVANC.BK.
