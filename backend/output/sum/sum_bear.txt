The asset is critically overvalued due to an unsustainable premium placed on future artificial intelligence growth, a narrative increasingly threatened by mounting headwinds. NVIDIA’s reliance on the Chinese market faces severe disruption from evolving U.S. export regulations and potential import bans, creating a significant revenue headwind that has not been adequately factored into current valuations. Intensifying competition from well-funded AI chip startups and aggressive moves from established rivals like Intel and AMD further erode NVIDIA's market share and pricing power, jeopardizing profit margins and justifying a downward revision of earnings estimates. Technically, the MACD bearish momentum signal, coupled with price action consolidating near the middle Bollinger Band, suggests a vulnerability to a downside correction, potentially pushing the stock towards a target range of $220-$240, representing a 25%-35% decline from current levels. These warning signs, dismissed by bullish analysts as short-term noise, highlight a precarious position where even modest setbacks could trigger a significant re-evaluation, leaving investors exposed to substantial losses.
