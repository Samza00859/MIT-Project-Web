The asset is critically overvalued due to a disconnect between its exorbitant Price-to-Earnings ratio of 302.9 and its decelerating earnings performance, rendering the current market capitalization unsustainable. Despite bullish narratives centered on speculative future revenues from AI and energy sectors, the core automotive business faces intensifying competition, exemplified by rivals like Ford encroaching on Tesla’s market share. Technical indicators corroborate this fundamental deterioration, with the price trading below key moving averages and exhibiting negative momentum divergence, signaling immediate selling pressure and a lack of buying conviction. The shift towards a subscription-only model for Full Self-Driving introduces significant adoption risk, potentially hindering anticipated recurring revenue growth. Considering these converging headwinds—unsustainable valuation, weakening fundamentals, and escalating competition—a substantial correction appears inevitable, presenting a clear opportunity for short sellers. We project a downside target of approximately $150-$175 per share, representing a potential decline of 40%-50% from current levels, making Tesla a compelling short candidate.
