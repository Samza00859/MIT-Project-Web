The asset is critically overvalued due to an unsustainable Price-to-Earnings ratio of 44, reflecting an unrealistic expectation of flawless execution within its AI narrative, leaving virtually no room for error or regional setbacks like those stemming from China’s export blockade of H200 chips. Technical analysis reveals a concerning pattern of distribution, with the stock trapped below key resistance levels at 188.85 and 190.53, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence histogram demonstrates waning bullish momentum—a precursor to bearish crossovers rather than a period of strength. The current consolidation phase, dismissed by some as a healthy base, appears instead as a precarious equilibrium susceptible to a downward resolution, particularly as support at the 50-day Simple Moving Average is repeatedly tested. A breach below 184.55 could trigger a cascade, potentially driving the price down to the Bollinger Lower Band at 178.70 and ultimately towards a December low near 170, representing a substantial downside risk. Compounding these vulnerabilities are escalating U.S.-EU trade tensions and the macroeconomic threat of surging global bond yields, both of which exacerbate NVIDIA’s premium valuation and expose it to a sharp correction in a broader market sell-off. Therefore, reducing exposure and protecting capital is warranted, awaiting a more realistic growth scenario or a significant price adjustment before considering renewed investment.
