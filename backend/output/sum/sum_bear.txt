The asset is critically overvalued despite a veneer of strategic maneuvering, presenting a compelling short opportunity with a potential downside risk of at least 20% towards the HKD 250 level. While recent headlines tout Tencent’s workaround for Nvidia chip access, this merely underscores the precariousness of its supply chain and exposes the company to escalating geopolitical risks and potential regulatory backlash, far from signifying resilience. Technical analysis reinforces this bearish outlook, with the stock trading decisively below key moving averages and exhibiting negative momentum, signaling a sustained downtrend rather than a fleeting oversold condition. Fundamental concerns linger, obscured by a lack of transparent valuation metrics, while a moderate debt-to-equity ratio amplifies vulnerability during anticipated market corrections. Intensifying competition in the AI sector, coupled with persistent regulatory scrutiny and a clouded global macroeconomic landscape, further erode any optimistic projections, making Tencent a demonstrably unattractive investment poised for a significant correction.
