The asset is critically overvalued due to an unsustainable premium valuation of 36.78 P/E, predicated on optimistic, yet unproven, future AI and growth narratives. This inflated price tag ignores the escalating regulatory pressures eroding Apple’s core Services moat, exemplified by the precedent-setting shift in Japan and the potential for similar actions across global markets. Technical analysis further reinforces the bearish outlook, revealing a confirmed short-term downtrend characterized by breaches of key moving averages and bearish momentum divergences, signaling accelerating selling pressure. The Volume Weighted Moving Average exceeding the current price indicates institutional distribution rather than accumulation, compounding concerns about sustained upward momentum. Immediate downside risk centers around a critical support confluence near $268, a failure of which could trigger a swift decline towards the $260 level, with limited upside potential capped by resistance zones around $275 and $280. Given the confluence of fundamental flaws, technical warnings, and mounting macroeconomic headwinds, prudent investors should avoid or reduce exposure, anticipating a significant correction as these risks become fully priced into the market.
