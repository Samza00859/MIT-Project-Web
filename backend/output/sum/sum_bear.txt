The asset is critically overvalued due to an unsustainable Price to Earnings ratio nearing 35, pricing in unrealistic expectations of perpetual growth and margin expansion that leave no buffer for inevitable operational setbacks. While bulls cling to outdated moving averages, technical indicators reveal a concerning deterioration, with declining momentum and a failure to sustain levels above the Bollinger Band signaling increased selling pressure. A breach of key support around $232 could trigger automated selling, accelerating a decline towards the 50-day Simple Moving Average near $226, representing a potential 3% drop. Beyond the immediate technical fragility, escalating regulatory scrutiny, exemplified by a recent €752 million EU antitrust fine, poses a systemic threat to Amazon’s business model and future profitability, a risk largely dismissed by optimistic analysts. Intensified cloud competition, coupled with macroeconomic headwinds impacting enterprise spending, further jeopardizes AWS growth, while substantial capital expenditures create volatile free cash flow and demand consistently high returns—a precarious cycle prone to reversal. Given these fundamental flaws, technical warnings, and mounting regulatory pressures, prudent investors should reduce exposure and anticipate a significant correction, targeting a valuation reset closer to $226.
