Retail sentiment has surged to Extreme Greed following the announcement of Apple’s strategic AI partnership with Google, triggering a significant spike in social media volume and buzz. The dominant narrative centers on Apple’s proactive move to integrate Google’s Gemini AI into Siri, fueling widespread optimism about the company’s position in the burgeoning AI landscape and its ability to capitalize on the technological revolution. This excitement is further amplified by Google’s recent market cap milestone, prompting comparisons and expectations for Apple’s own financial performance. While institutional options activity remains neutral, the overall psychological tone is overwhelmingly positive, characterized by a palpable sense of FOMO among retail investors eager to participate in what appears to be a transformative moment for Apple. However, the exceptionally high volume accompanying this bullish sentiment warrants caution; such concentrated enthusiasm often precedes periods of consolidation or correction, suggesting a potential near-term volatility event.
