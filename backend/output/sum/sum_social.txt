Retail sentiment surrounding Tesla has decisively pivoted toward fear and doubt, fueled by a growing narrative questioning the company’s valuation amidst reports of weakening sales and unmet expectations. While overall social volume remains moderate, the intensity of negative commentary concerning Elon Musk’s actions and the controversy surrounding xAI’s Grok demonstrates a palpable shift in public perception. The dominant discourse centers on concerns that Tesla is significantly overvalued, amplified by anxieties about leadership and product delivery. Notably, mentions of institutional options trading activity have emerged, but lack a clear directional signal, suggesting a cautious approach from larger investors. This confluence of factors indicates a potential for increased volatility as retail investors grapple with uncertainty and the possibility of a market correction, potentially signaling a near-term peak in enthusiasm.
