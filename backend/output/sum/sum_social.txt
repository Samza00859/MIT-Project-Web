Retail sentiment has shifted towards cautious optimism, fueled by NVIDIA’s technical recovery following a recent 20% pullback, creating a palpable Fear Of Missing Out among investors. Elevated social volume, driven by a confluence of factors including the stock’s price rebound, reports of potential China market access in early 2026, and ongoing insider selling news, underscores the heightened attention surrounding the company. While concerns regarding a $40 million board member share sale generate mixed reactions—interpreted by some as normal profit-taking—the dominant narrative centers on renewed optimism and analyst price targets hovering around $190, with longer-term projections reaching $240-$252. Notably, consistently high institutional options activity indicates sustained professional interest, even amidst valuation debates and competition concerns with AMD. The resumption of H200 AI chip shipments to China before Lunar New Year further amplifies positive sentiment. However, the sheer volume of discussion, coupled with the rapid shift in investor psychology, suggests a potential for increased volatility and warrants close monitoring for signs of a possible near-term peak.
