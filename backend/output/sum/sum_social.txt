Retail sentiment has surged to a state of Fear Of Missing Out, fueled by a significant spike in social media volume coinciding with Cisco Systems’ achievement of a 25-year high and its perceived leadership in AI infrastructure. The dominant narrative centers on Cisco’s resurgence, surpassing its dot-com era peak, largely attributed to its pivotal role in providing essential AI networking components like Silicon One chips and the Splunk integration. While institutional confidence is bolstered by Morgan Stanley’s increased price target, a subtle undercurrent of caution persists, drawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble and questioning whether the current AI hype overshadows fundamental business realities. This blend of optimism and apprehension suggests a potential for volatility; the elevated volume, while indicative of widespread enthusiasm, could also signal a market correction as investors grapple with the sustainability of these gains beyond historical benchmarks.
