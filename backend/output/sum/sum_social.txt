Due to critical parsing errors across all analytical modules, a reliable assessment of current retail sentiment remains unavailable. The absence of discernible volume trends or dominant narratives further complicates the situation, preventing identification of potential psychological shifts like FOMO or panic. Consequently, we cannot determine if the market is exhibiting signs of extreme greed, fear, or capitulation. This unprecedented data failure warrants immediate investigation into the underlying systems, as the lack of actionable intelligence poses a significant risk to informed decision-making. Until these issues are resolved, caution is advised, and any trading strategies should be approached with heightened skepticism, recognizing the possibility of unexpected volatility stemming from unobserved market dynamics.
