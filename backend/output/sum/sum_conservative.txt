The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the prevailing bearish technical indicators and emerging macroeconomic headwinds. Current valuations appear stretched, particularly when considering the potential for sector-wide capital expenditure reductions related to artificial intelligence initiatives. A persistent downtrend, underscored by prices trading below key moving averages and negative momentum signals, suggests continued selling pressure and heightened vulnerability. The fragility of the current market setup is further exposed by the proximity to the critical $380 support level, where a breach could trigger a significant and rapid decline, potentially amplified by moderate volatility. Therefore, prioritizing capital preservation through a strict HOLD strategy is paramount, eschewing any new positions until a confirmed technical reversal—such as a decisive reclaim of the 10-day exponential moving average—provides a more favorable risk-reward profile.
