The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the confluence of significant operational headwinds and macroeconomic uncertainties currently impacting the market. Dismissing tangible challenges as mere "noise" overlooks the potential for substantial capital destruction, particularly when considering the state-mandated disruptions affecting critical revenue streams and escalating global trade tensions. The technical indicators further reinforce this concern, revealing stagnant price action and waning momentum, suggesting vulnerability to resistance levels and potential downside risks. With valuations stretched to an unsustainable 46x P/E ratio, the fragility of the current setup is evident, and a negative catalyst—such as a guidance miss triggered by the ongoing China disruption—could swiftly erode market value. Therefore, prudence dictates severely limiting exposure, maintaining minimal position sizes, and implementing tight stop-loss orders below key support levels to safeguard capital and await more favorable risk-reward dynamics. Prioritizing cash reserves allows for opportunistic entry during periods of greater stability and reduced uncertainty.
