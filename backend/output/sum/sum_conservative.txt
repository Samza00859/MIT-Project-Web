The Conservative view strongly advises caution regarding AMD, as the prevailing optimism surrounding AI advancements and technical momentum overlooks substantial downside risks. While recent revenue growth and positive cash flow may appear encouraging, the exceptionally high P/E ratio of 116.3 renders the investment inherently fragile and vulnerable to even minor setbacks. The anticipated AI product launches in 2026 carry no guarantee of success, and intensifying competition from established players like Nvidia poses a credible threat to AMD's market share. Furthermore, newly imposed US tariffs could significantly impede international sales, a crucial engine for growth, while the current price proximity to resistance levels, coupled with moderate volatility, suggests a potential for a sharp correction. Given the possibility of a broader economic downturn, which would disproportionately impact highly valued growth stocks, prioritizing capital preservation is paramount. Therefore, we recommend a drastically reduced position size and a tightly managed stop-loss strategy to mitigate the risk of catastrophic losses, ultimately favoring a more defensive posture and awaiting a more favorable risk-reward profile before increasing exposure.
