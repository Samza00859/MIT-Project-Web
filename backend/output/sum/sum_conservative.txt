The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the prevailing market conditions, which appear to discount substantial downside risks. While recent developments may offer fleeting optimism, the underlying technical indicators present a concerning picture of sustained bearish momentum, with prices trading below critical moving averages and a widening MACD histogram signaling persistent selling pressure. The oversold RSI, rather than indicating a potential reversal, reflects underlying distress within the market. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions and ongoing regulatory scrutiny represent latent threats capable of swiftly eroding any temporary gains. This fragile setup necessitates a highly defensive posture, prioritizing capital preservation through reduced position sizes and the implementation of significantly tighter stop-loss orders to mitigate the potential for rapid and substantial losses should support levels at 610.00 or 602.24 be breached. Prioritize cash and await more favorable risk-reward dynamics before re-engaging.
