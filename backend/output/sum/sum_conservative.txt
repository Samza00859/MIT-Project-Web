The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the confluence of technical indicators signaling waning momentum and heightened vulnerability. Current valuations appear stretched, particularly with a P/E ratio of 34.86, leaving little margin for error should adverse news emerge regarding AWS margins or potential European regulatory penalties. Macroeconomic headwinds further complicate the outlook, and the recent failure to sustain the $246.29 resistance level underscores the fragility of the present setup. A breakdown below key moving averages—the 10-day EMA and VWMA—could trigger a more substantial correction towards $226 or lower, potentially exposing significant downside risk. Therefore, prioritizing capital preservation is paramount; any engagement should involve drastically reduced position sizes coupled with stringent stop-loss orders positioned immediately below the VWMA to mitigate potential losses. Prioritize cash and await a clearer demonstration of sustainable upward momentum before re-evaluating exposure.
