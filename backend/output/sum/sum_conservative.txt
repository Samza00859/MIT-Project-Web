The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the concerning confluence of technical indicators suggesting a potential market downturn. Recent bearish signals—a MACD crossover, prices falling below key moving averages, and a declining RSI—indicate a shift in momentum rather than a mere consolidation. Macroeconomic headwinds, including rising unemployment and a hawkish Federal Reserve outlook for 2026, further amplify these concerns. The current market setup appears fragile, with a critical support level at the 50-day Simple Moving Average of $674.79 representing a potential breaking point. A decisive breach of this level could initiate a rapid decline towards the lower Bollinger Band at $656, exacerbating losses. Therefore, prioritizing capital preservation is paramount; we recommend holding existing positions and refraining from initiating new long exposures until these substantial downside risks are demonstrably mitigated and a clearer recovery trend emerges.
