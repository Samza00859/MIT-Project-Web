The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the current market conditions, particularly concerning valuations that appear stretched and macroeconomic headwinds that remain unresolved. Pursuing opportunities at elevated levels, such as purchasing near technical resistance with a historically high price-to-earnings ratio, presents an unacceptable level of risk. The anticipated catalyst from China carries significant geopolitical uncertainty and may not materialize as quickly as projected, leaving the asset vulnerable to a rapid correction. This fragility is underscored by the potential for a substantial price decline should the anticipated breakout fail, potentially triggering a pullback towards key moving averages and resulting in a notable short-term loss. Therefore, we prioritize capital preservation and recommend minimizing exposure to such speculative ventures, awaiting more favorable risk-reward dynamics before considering further investment.
