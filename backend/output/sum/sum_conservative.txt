The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the discernible technical deterioration and prevailing market uncertainties. Current price action suggests a confirmed downtrend, rather than a temporary pullback, underscored by institutional selling indicated by declining volume and negative momentum signals. A significant concern lies in the asset’s elevated valuation, reflected in a high P/E ratio, coupled with potential regulatory pressures impacting key revenue streams. This fragility is further amplified by the proximity to critical support levels; a breach below $268 could initiate a rapid descent towards $229, representing a substantial capital loss. Therefore, prudence dictates an exceptionally limited exposure, accompanied by immediate stop-loss protection just below $267, recognizing that present conditions resemble speculative gambling rather than sound investment. Prioritize cash and await more favorable risk-reward dynamics before considering re-entry.
