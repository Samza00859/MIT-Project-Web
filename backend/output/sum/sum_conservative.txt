The Conservative view strongly advises caution regarding the current investment climate, recognizing a precarious consolidation phase marked by weakening momentum and concerning technical indicators such as a negative MACD and declining volume. While acknowledging a potentially bullish long-term trend, the fragility of the underlying macro narrative – particularly reliance on Baht-driven inflows – presents a significant vulnerability to reversal. A shift in global risk sentiment or a downturn in the Baht could swiftly trigger an exodus, exposing the asset to substantial downside risk, especially considering the bank’s inherent leverage and the slowing domestic economy. Therefore, any exposure should be minimal and rigorously protected by a tight stop-loss order just below the critical 190.5 support level, as the potential for losses now demonstrably exceeds the diminishing prospects for gains. Prioritizing capital preservation and awaiting more favorable risk-reward dynamics remains the prudent course of action.
