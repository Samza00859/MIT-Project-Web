The Conservative view strongly advises caution regarding current market positioning, particularly concerning PTT.BK, despite recent positive developments like the LNG deal and observed technical strength. However, prevailing global macroeconomic conditions present significant headwinds, characterized by escalating trade tensions and heightened geopolitical instability, factors already driving investors towards safer assets. Current valuations appear stretched, with the stock nearing an upper Bollinger Band resistance level, suggesting a potential for abrupt correction. This fragility demands a markedly reduced exposure and the implementation of stringent stop-loss measures to safeguard capital against a possible sharp reversal towards established support levels. Prioritizing cash reserves and adopting a patient approach to await more favorable risk-reward dynamics remains the most prudent course of action.
