The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the concerning confluence of technical and macroeconomic factors currently impacting this asset. The prevailing market sentiment leans decidedly risk-off, and the stock’s elevated valuation leaves it particularly vulnerable to adverse developments. Technical indicators, including a weakening MACD histogram and unsuccessful challenge of key resistance levels, suggest waning momentum rather than a temporary consolidation. Geopolitical uncertainties, specifically the potential fallout from CEO Huang’s visit to China amidst escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and EU, present a significant downside risk, potentially triggering a sharp correction should export blockades persist. The fragility of the current setup necessitates a proactive approach to capital preservation; therefore, we recommend a swift reduction in exposure, coupled with a tight stop-loss order positioned below the critical support level of 184.55. Prioritizing cash and awaiting more favorable risk-reward dynamics appears prudent in this volatile and unpredictable environment.
