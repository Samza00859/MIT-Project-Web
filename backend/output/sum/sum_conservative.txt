The Conservative view strongly advises caution regarding Tencent, as recent optimism surrounding AI capabilities and share buybacks fails to adequately address substantial downside risks. Geopolitical tensions between the United States and China remain a persistent threat, and Tencent's indirect chip access underscores its vulnerability to potential sanctions and regulatory actions. Technical indicators currently present a concerning picture, with the price trading below key moving averages and exhibiting bearish momentum, suggesting further declines are probable. This fragile setup is susceptible to sudden shifts in sentiment driven by unforeseen events, potentially rendering positive news a fleeting distraction. Therefore, prioritizing capital preservation necessitates a significantly reduced position size coupled with an exceptionally tight stop-loss order, acknowledging the distinct possibility of considerable losses. We recommend prioritizing cash reserves and awaiting more favorable risk-reward conditions before re-evaluating exposure.
