The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the precariousness of the current market environment. While recent momentum may appear compelling, valuations have reached an unsustainable level, as evidenced by an overbought Relative Strength Index and proximity to the upper Bollinger Band, signaling a heightened risk of a corrective reversal. Macroeconomic headwinds further complicate the picture, with concerning developments such as South Korea’s economic contraction underscoring underlying global fragility. The telecommunications sector’s capital-intensive nature, combined with elevated debt levels, creates a particularly vulnerable situation where a shift in market sentiment could trigger substantial losses. Therefore, prudence dictates a significant reduction in exposure and the implementation of more stringent risk management protocols, prioritizing capital preservation and awaiting a more favorable risk-reward dynamic before re-engaging.
