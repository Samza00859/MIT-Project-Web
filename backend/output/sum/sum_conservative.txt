The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the precarious nature of the current market environment, where valuations appear stretched and macroeconomic headwinds are intensifying. A prevailing sense of euphoria should not be mistaken for a sustainable trend, as history demonstrates that such periods often precede abrupt corrections. Technical indicators reveal a concerning fragility, with the RSI nearing overbought territory and price action encountering significant resistance, suggesting a potential for a sharp mean reversion. Escalating regulatory pressures in key markets further compound the risks, threatening profitability and introducing unpredictable liabilities. Therefore, a prudent approach necessitates an immediate reduction in position size and the implementation of tight stop-loss orders to safeguard against unexpected volatility and protect capital from potentially debilitating losses. Prioritizing liquidity and awaiting more favorable risk-reward dynamics remains the most responsible course of action.
