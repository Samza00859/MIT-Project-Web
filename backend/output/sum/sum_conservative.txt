The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the confluence of concerning technical indicators and mounting fundamental risks. Current price action sits demonstrably below key moving averages, accompanied by bearish momentum signals and an RSI that has yet to reach oversold levels, suggesting potential for further declines. This fragility is compounded by external pressures, including intensifying political scrutiny and credible accounting concerns, which threaten to erode the underlying bullish narrative and institutional support. A breach of immediate support at 174.67 could trigger a rapid cascade towards 165.00, amplified by heightened volatility. Therefore, prioritizing capital preservation is paramount; any investment at this juncture represents speculative risk. We recommend holding existing positions and awaiting a confirmed technical reversal—specifically, a decisive reclaim of the 10 EMA—alongside a demonstrable easing of regulatory anxieties before contemplating a limited, carefully sized entry.
