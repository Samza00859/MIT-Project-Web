The Conservative view strongly advises caution given the recent market exuberance, which presents a precarious moment for capital preservation. While acknowledging the allure of a "historic breakout," we observe that such sentiment-driven rallies are inherently vulnerable to abrupt reversals, particularly after prolonged upward trajectories. Technical indicators, including a negative MACD histogram, price proximity to the Bollinger upper band, and decelerating momentum, signal heightened fragility and foreshadow a potential correction. Macroeconomic headwinds, such as the possibility of Japanese interest rate adjustments and persistent AI sector volatility, further amplify these concerns. A plausible worst-case scenario involves a swift decline to critical support levels around $70.00 or even the 200-day simple moving average at $65.47. Therefore, we recommend a highly conservative approach, prioritizing cash reserves and implementing stringent risk management protocols, including tight stop-loss orders below $74.89, to safeguard against potentially catastrophic losses should the current rally falter.
