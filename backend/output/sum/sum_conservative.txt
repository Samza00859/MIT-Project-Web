The Conservative view strongly advises caution regarding COM7, as the prevailing optimism fails to adequately account for substantial downside risks. While recent financial performance may appear encouraging, the company’s considerable inventory—exceeding twelve billion THB—represents a significant vulnerability should consumer demand weaken. Current technical indicators paint a concerning picture, signaling a bearish trend and increasing the likelihood of further price declines. Macroeconomic headwinds, particularly persistent inflation and anticipated interest rate increases, threaten to curtail consumer spending, directly impacting COM7’s core retail operations. Furthermore, escalating geopolitical tensions introduce additional uncertainty and potential disruptions to crucial supply chains. This fragile setup necessitates a dramatically reduced position size, coupled with a strict stop-loss mechanism to safeguard capital against a potential market correction. Prioritize cash and await more favorable risk-reward conditions before re-evaluating exposure.
