The Conservative view strongly advises caution regarding NIO, as current valuations appear disconnected from the company’s underlying financial performance and technical indicators suggest significant downside risk. While revenue growth has been observed, it fails to offset persistent net losses and declining free cash flow, raising serious concerns about long-term sustainability. The impending ‘death cross’ formation, coupled with price action below crucial moving averages, underscores the fragility of the current market sentiment and highlights potential support levels at 4.63 and 4.99 as critical points of vulnerability. Given the inherent uncertainties surrounding global macroeconomic conditions and intensifying competitive pressures, a sudden shift in investor sentiment could trigger a substantial decline in the stock price, potentially far below these support levels. Therefore, prioritizing capital preservation through a drastic reduction in exposure and the implementation of stringent stop-loss measures is paramount; awaiting more favorable risk-reward dynamics before re-evaluating investment opportunities remains the prudent course of action.
