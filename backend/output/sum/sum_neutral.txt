The Neutral view suggests a measured approach, recognizing both the potential for continued growth and the inherent risks within the current market environment. While an aggressively bullish outlook overlooks recent momentum deceleration and looming regulatory concerns, a purely defensive posture risks prematurely abandoning a fundamentally sound, upward trend supported by robust volume. This creates a tension between capitalizing on established strengths and safeguarding against potential downturns. Acknowledging this dynamic, a prudent strategy involves establishing a standard, non-leveraged long position, predicated on the underlying strength of the asset while strategically utilizing the identified support zone around $232 as a trigger for incremental additions rather than a rigid stop-loss mechanism. This balanced approach seeks to capture upside potential while mitigating downside exposure through disciplined capital allocation.
