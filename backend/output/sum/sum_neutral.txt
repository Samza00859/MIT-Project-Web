The Neutral view suggests a measured approach given conflicting signals within the current market environment. While underlying fundamentals remain robust and indicative of a long-term bullish trajectory, short-term momentum has weakened, accompanied by a discernible shift toward bearish sentiment. This creates a tension between the potential for continued gains and the immediate risk of consolidation or correction. A purely bullish stance, as advocated by some, disregards these near-term headwinds, while an overly cautious strategy risks missing out on opportunities. Therefore, a prudent compromise involves maintaining existing positions while exercising restraint with new capital. A scaled entry strategy, initiated upon a sustained rebound from the 50-day simple moving average with a protective stop-loss, followed by further allocation upon decisively breaching the 10-day exponential moving average, offers a balance between capitalizing on the prevailing trend and mitigating short-term uncertainties.
