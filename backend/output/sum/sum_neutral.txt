The Neutral view suggests a measured response to current market conditions, acknowledging both substantial upside potential and emerging risks. While some analysts highlight the disregard for overbought indicators and regulatory concerns alongside an elevated price-to-earnings ratio, others caution against prematurely abandoning a strong bullish trend fueled by compelling long-term artificial intelligence catalysts. The prevailing reality presents a robust uptrend now encountering a heightened probability of near-term volatility. Recognizing this risk-reward tension, a prudent compromise involves strategically reducing exposure rather than a complete exit. This entails partially selling to secure gains and establish a more favorable cost basis, while maintaining a core position protected by a stop-loss order positioned slightly below the 236.18 VWMA support level. Such an approach seeks to balance the need to mitigate correction risks with continued participation in the underlying bullish narrative.
