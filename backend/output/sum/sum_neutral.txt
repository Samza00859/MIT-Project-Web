The Neutral view suggests a measured approach to Tencent, recognizing both compelling opportunities and substantial risks. While optimistic assessments highlight the company’s strategic AI chip access and ongoing share buybacks as signs of operational strength and management conviction, these positives are counterbalanced by prevailing bearish technical indicators and persistent geopolitical uncertainties. Dismissing these systemic headwinds as merely “nebulous risks” proves imprudent, yet an overly cautious stance risks missing potential risk-adjusted returns. The inherent tension lies in navigating this duality—acknowledging the possibility of further declines while simultaneously recognizing the tangible benefits of Tencent’s proactive measures. A prudent compromise involves initiating a moderately sized position, perhaps half the initially planned allocation, to safeguard capital while still allowing participation in potential upside driven by AI advancements. Crucially, a strict stop-loss order should be implemented just below the 602.00 support level to effectively mitigate severe downside exposure.
