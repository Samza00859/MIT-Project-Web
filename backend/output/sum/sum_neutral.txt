The Neutral view suggests a measured approach given conflicting signals regarding current market conditions. While a confirmed bullish trend and a significant catalyst indicate potential upside, the asset’s position at the upper Bollinger Band raises concerns about overvaluation and immediate technical resistance. Conversely, demanding an ideal, low-risk entry point could result in missed opportunities as the upward momentum persists. This creates a risk-reward tension where aggressive positioning exposes traders to downside risk, while excessive caution may forgo substantial gains. A prudent compromise involves initiating a modest position to capitalize on existing momentum, while reserving the bulk of capital for a more favorable entry on a pullback to the $182-$185 support level, fortified by a protective stop-loss below the 10 EMA to manage potential losses.
