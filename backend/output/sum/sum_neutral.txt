The Neutral view suggests a measured approach amidst conflicting market signals. While aggressive buying advocated by some risks overlooking decelerating momentum and reliance on a singular catalyst, conversely, overly cautious strategies may forfeit participation in the prevailing bullish trend supported by consistent fund inflows. This creates a risk-reward tension where expanding exposure appears unwarranted given heightened leverage, yet diminishing existing holdings could prove premature considering the established long-term uptrend. Therefore, a pragmatic compromise involves maintaining the current position while vigilantly observing the 190.5 support level; a decisive breach below this threshold accompanied by increased volume would necessitate a reduction in exposure, effectively balancing continued trend participation with the imperative of safeguarding capital.
