The Neutral view suggests a wait-and-see approach due to conflicting signals regarding the asset's trajectory. While a robust primary uptrend persists, supported by prices above key moving averages and a neutral Relative Strength Index, short-term momentum exhibits signs of deceleration and overbought conditions, historically preceding pullbacks. Aggressive buy calls appear speculative, overlooking these warning signs, while overly cautious stances risk missing a significant upward trend. This creates a risk-reward tension where chasing current highs presents unfavorable odds, yet ignoring the established bullish structure could lead to missed opportunities. Therefore, a prudent compromise involves maintaining existing positions with a protective stop-loss just below the Bollinger middle band at $74.89, and reserving new capital for a more favorable entry point—a potential pullback towards the 50-day Simple Moving Average around $71.46—rather than participating at prevailing elevated levels.
