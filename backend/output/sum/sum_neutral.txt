The Neutral view suggests a measured approach given conflicting signals regarding current market conditions. While underlying fundamentals and valuation metrics present a compelling case for a sustained upward trend with robust support around $268, short-term technical indicators reveal persistent selling pressure that has yet to fully subside. This creates a risk-reward tension where aggressive positioning could expose investors to further downside, while excessive caution risks missing out on potential gains. Therefore, a prudent compromise involves initiating a partial position now, capitalizing on the attractive valuation backdrop and anticipated catalysts, while simultaneously reserving capital to strategically average down should the price demonstrate stabilization by surpassing the 10-day EMA or the MACD histogram exhibit signs of flattening—ultimately aiming to enhance the overall entry price and mitigate ongoing momentum risk.
