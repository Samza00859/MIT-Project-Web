The Neutral view suggests a measured approach amidst conflicting market signals. While robust long-term fundamentals provide a foundation for potential growth, immediate short-term headwinds present significant challenges. An overly aggressive accumulation strategy carries the risk of substantial losses given prevailing bearish technical indicators and concerning news developments. Conversely, demanding absolute confirmation before action could result in a missed opportunity should the market rebound from established fundamental support levels. Recognizing this risk-reward tension, a prudent compromise involves initiating a modest, disciplined position to gain early exposure while reserving the bulk of capital for subsequent investment. This allows for participation in potential upside while mitigating downside risk, with further accumulation contingent upon a confirmed technical stabilization—such as a daily close above the 10-day EMA—signaling a shift in short-term momentum and improving the overall risk-reward profile.
