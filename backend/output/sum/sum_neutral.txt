The Neutral view suggests a measured approach to NVIDIA, acknowledging both compelling bullish indicators and emerging bearish pressures. While accelerating selling volume and bearish momentum raise concerns of a potential 5-6% correction, the company’s robust fundamentals and positive catalysts cannot be disregarded. Price currently approaches a crucial test at the $174.80 Bollinger support within a prevailing long-term uptrend, creating a favorable risk-reward asymmetry. However, demanding a flawless reversal signal risks missing an opportune entry near this support, while ignoring the bearish signals could expose investors to a significant drawdown. Therefore, a prudent compromise involves a scaled entry strategy: initiating a partial position at current levels with a tight stop just below $174.80, reserving additional capital for deployment only upon a confirmed bullish reversal signaled by a break above the 10-EMA accompanied by supportive volume, thus balancing conviction with diligent risk management.
