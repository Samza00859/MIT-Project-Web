The Neutral view suggests a measured approach given conflicting signals regarding the asset's trajectory. While the underlying long-term fundamental thesis remains compelling, recent technical indicators reveal a concerning consolidation pattern accompanied by waning momentum and heightened geopolitical anxieties. A purely bullish stance, dismissing these developments, carries substantial risk of a deeper correction, whereas an immediate sell response could prematurely abandon a promising growth narrative. The current risk-reward dynamic presents a tension between capitalizing on potential upside and mitigating downside vulnerability. Therefore, a prudent compromise involves strategically reducing existing exposure to secure gains and establish a lower cost basis, while reserving further investment until clearer market direction emerges—either through a decisive resurgence above key resistance levels coupled with increased volume or a controlled decline to robust support zones.
