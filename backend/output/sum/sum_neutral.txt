The Neutral view suggests a measured approach amidst conflicting signals regarding current market conditions. While strong underlying fundamentals and a dominant market presence present a compelling case for investment, a recent state-mandated shipment blockade introduces significant uncertainty, threatening to undermine valuations prematurely. Dismissing this disruption entirely carries substantial risk, yet excessive caution could lead to missing out on the ongoing AI-driven growth trajectory. Technical indicators currently reflect a period of neutral consolidation and waning momentum, further complicating the decision-making process. Recognizing this risk-reward tension, a prudent compromise involves establishing a modest, unleveraged core position to maintain exposure while deferring the bulk of capital allocation. This strategy allows for participation in potential upside while mitigating downside risk, contingent upon a decisive technical breakout above the 193 resistance level, signaling that the market has adequately priced in the near-term geopolitical headwinds.
