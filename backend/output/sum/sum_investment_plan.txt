The plan is to ACCUMULATE shares of Apple, capitalizing on its exceptional financial health and promising growth trajectory. A decisive factor supporting this recommendation is Apple’s substantial free cash flow of $98.8 billion and impressive Return on Equity of 151.9%, indicating efficient capital allocation and strong shareholder value creation. Positive analyst forecasts, particularly Morgan Stanley’s target of $315 driven by anticipated iPhone demand and AI monetization, further bolster the outlook. We advocate for an urgent purchase within the $270 range, leveraging the current pullback as an optimal entry point within a sustained bullish trend, targeting initial resistance levels at $274 and $278. However, the primary risk lies in intensifying regulatory scrutiny, specifically potential antitrust actions that could negatively impact high-margin service revenues, thereby jeopardizing projected growth.
