The plan is to SELL Tesla shares, driven by a consensus assessment of extreme overvaluation and concerning fundamental trends. The bearish analysis prevailed due to overwhelming evidence of an unsustainable Price-to-Earnings ratio exceeding 300, coupled with weakening sales, increasing competition, and declining free cash flow. This conclusion is further reinforced by negative technical indicators signaling immediate selling pressure and a lack of market conviction. We recommend an immediate exit from existing positions to mitigate substantial downside risk, targeting a price reduction commensurate with a more realistic valuation reflecting current market conditions and competitive dynamics. The most critical risk to monitor is the adoption rate of the Full Self-Driving subscription model; failure to achieve widespread acceptance could exacerbate downward pressure and invalidate the current assessment.
