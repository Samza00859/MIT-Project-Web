The plan is to ACCUMULATE shares of Amazon, capitalizing on a confluence of fundamental growth acceleration and robust technical resilience. The research team’s bullish assessment prevailed, underpinned by the expectation of significantly improved profitability stemming from expanding Amazon Web Services margins and escalating high-margin advertising revenues—factors already demonstrating substantial traction. This conviction is further bolstered by a considerable $200 billion revenue backlog, providing clear visibility into future earnings, and the stock’s consistent performance above key moving averages, signaling strong underlying support. Immediate action is warranted, initiating a long position with the goal of surpassing the resistance level at $246.29 to target the November high of $250.20, anticipating a favorable shift in artificial intelligence sentiment by 2026. However, a sustained decline below the Volume Weighted Moving Average support at $232.79 would serve as a critical warning sign, potentially indicating technical weakness and necessitating a reassessment of the investment thesis.
