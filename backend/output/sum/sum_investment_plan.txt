The plan is to SELL NVIDIA, recognizing a deteriorating technical landscape and unsustainable valuation amidst growing geopolitical uncertainties. The prevailing argument centers on the stock’s recent inability to overcome resistance at 188.85, coupled with a declining MACD histogram indicative of waning bullish momentum—a signal of potential bearish resolution. While NVIDIA benefits from its position in the burgeoning AI sector, the current P/E ratio of 44 appears excessively optimistic, leaving little room for error given the potential impact of China export restrictions and broader global tensions. Immediate action is warranted, particularly on any rallies approaching the 189 resistance, to mitigate the elevated risk of a breakdown below the 184.55 support level. A decisive breach of this level would confirm bearish momentum and likely initiate a decline toward the Bollinger Lower Band at 178.70, effectively invalidating the premise of a bullish consolidation.
