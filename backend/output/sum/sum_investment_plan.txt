The plan is to urgently accumulate shares of Nvidia, driven by its dominant fundamental position and exceptional long-term growth prospects within the burgeoning AI infrastructure super-cycle. Nvidia’s full-stack ecosystem, anchored by the CUDA platform, establishes a formidable competitive advantage that rivals struggle to match, evidenced by impressive financial performance including robust revenue growth and substantial profit margins. We view the current market pullback, characterized by a test of Bollinger Band support and short-term moving average breaches, as a strategic entry zone within a sustained uptrend validated by the 200-day Simple Moving Average. However, the current valuation, reflected in a P/E ratio of 43.31, necessitates continued flawless execution; therefore, a key risk to monitor is potential valuation compression stemming from a slowdown in revenue growth or adverse regulatory developments impacting sales in China, which could trigger a significant multiple contraction despite Nvidia’s underlying strengths.
