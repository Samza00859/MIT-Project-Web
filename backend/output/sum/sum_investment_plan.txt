The plan is to SELL our existing positions in Tencent, driven by a confluence of systemic risks that currently outweigh the company’s operational strengths. While Tencent demonstrates resourcefulness in navigating AI hardware procurement, this reliance on indirect channels exposes a critical geopolitical vulnerability, particularly concerning US-China relations and potential sanctions. Technical indicators further reinforce this view, with the stock exhibiting bearish trends and lacking supportive valuation metrics. Therefore, we recommend an immediate divestment to safeguard capital, prioritizing a swift exit from the current holdings. The primary risk that could invalidate this strategy is an unexpected de-escalation of geopolitical tensions, leading to improved access to technology and a more favorable regulatory environment, potentially reversing the downward pressure on the stock.
