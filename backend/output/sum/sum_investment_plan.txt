The plan is to ACCUMULATE, driven by a confirmed long-term bullish trend and robust corporate fundamentals demonstrated by 8% year-over-year revenue growth and an 18% Return on Equity for the S&P 500 aggregate. Technical indicators further reinforce this view, showing a healthy consolidation within the uptrend with the Relative Strength Index at a neutral level, presenting opportunities for advancement. We recommend an urgent purchase on any current dip, utilizing the 50-day Simple Moving Average around $674.79 as a key entry point, with the objective of achieving a breakout toward the Bollinger Upper Band resistance at $697.69. However, a decisive breach below the 50-day Simple Moving Average support would signal a momentum shift and necessitate a reassessment of the position, potentially leading to a decline towards the $652.53 level.
