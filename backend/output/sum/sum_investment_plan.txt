The plan is to SELL Apple shares, driven by concerns regarding severe overvaluation and technical exhaustion outweighing potential future growth prospects. The prevailing argument centers on the unsustainable Price-to-Earnings ratio of 36.62, demanding flawless execution amidst increasing regulatory pressures that threaten Apple’s high-margin revenue streams. Technical indicators further reinforce this view, with an extreme Relative Strength Index reading of 83.25 signaling an overbought condition historically preceding sharp corrections, coupled with price stalling at key resistance levels suggesting distribution. Immediate execution is advised to secure gains or reduce exposure, anticipating a likely near-term corrective pullback towards the Volume Weighted Moving Average support around $236.18. The primary risk to this strategy lies in intensified regulatory actions or delays in the anticipated 2026 AI product launches, potentially triggering a deeper correction and accelerating the decline from current overextended levels.
