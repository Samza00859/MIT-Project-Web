The plan is to ACCUMULATE shares of Apple based on a compelling long-term bullish outlook supported by the stock’s persistent uptrend, evident in its position above the 200-day Simple Moving Average. A recent pullback has created a high-probability entry point around current levels, coinciding with strong support at the 50-day Simple Moving Average and Bollinger Lower Band near $268. This opportunity is further reinforced by anticipated growth catalysts, including a major iPhone cycle coupled with the integration of advanced artificial intelligence capabilities through Siri 2.0, as underscored by positive analyst projections. Given the company’s substantial free cash flow and ongoing share repurchase programs, we recommend immediate execution to capitalize on this temporary dip, establishing a stop-loss order below the $268 support level. However, a sustained breach of this support zone would signal a potential shift in market sentiment and require a reevaluation of our strategy.
