The plan is to SELL Nio Inc. due to the company’s unsustainable financial condition, which poses an unacceptable level of risk to capital. Despite promising revenue growth and technological innovation, Nio’s persistent net losses, negative free cash flow, and highly leveraged balance sheet create a precarious situation, rendering the company overly reliant on continuous external funding. This fundamental weakness outweighs any potential upside, particularly given the confluence of bearish technical signals—including trading below key moving averages and an impending death cross—indicating significant immediate downside risk. An immediate exit is therefore warranted to safeguard against further declines, with entry considered only after a demonstrably clear and credible path to profitability and positive free cash flow is established. The primary risk that would invalidate this plan is Nio’s failure to achieve sustained profitability and positive free cash flow, leaving the investment vulnerable to market volatility and funding challenges.
