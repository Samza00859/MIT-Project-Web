The plan is to urgently SELL, driven by accelerating technical deterioration and unsustainable valuation concerns. A confirmed bearish Moving Average Convergence Divergence crossover, coupled with the stock trading below key moving averages, indicates significant distribution and institutional selling pressure. This technical weakness is compounded by an elevated Price-to-Earnings ratio of 36.62, leaving little margin for error given escalating regulatory threats targeting Apple’s App Store ecosystem and potentially impacting future services revenue. Immediate action is required to mitigate potential downside risks, particularly a breach below the $269 support level, which could trigger a rapid decline. The primary risk to this strategy is the intensification of global regulatory actions forcing open Apple’s closed ecosystem, thereby undermining its established profit model.
