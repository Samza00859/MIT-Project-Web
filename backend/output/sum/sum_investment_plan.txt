The plan is to HOLD our position in Tencent Holdings Limited, reflecting the current market’s ambiguous signals and the absence of definitive valuation data. While short-term technical indicators suggest waning momentum, the stock’s resilience around the 200-day moving average and Tencent’s proactive acquisition of AI chips demonstrate underlying strength and adaptability amidst geopolitical complexities. This strategic move, however, introduces heightened regulatory and supply chain risks that warrant caution. We will maintain our existing allocation, observing for improved valuation multiples—particularly the Price to Earnings Ratio—and monitoring the evolving global technology landscape. Entry into a more assertive position will be considered once these uncertainties subside, but until then, patience is paramount. The primary risk that could invalidate this strategy is an escalation of international trade tensions, potentially disrupting Tencent’s access to vital components and services.
