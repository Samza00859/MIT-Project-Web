The plan is to SELL PTT Public Company Limited, prioritizing the mitigation of immediate downside risk amidst concerning technical and macroeconomic factors. The prevailing sentiment stems from the stock’s precarious technical position, exhibiting significant overbought conditions signaled by its Relative Strength Index and proximity to the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting a likely correction. This vulnerability is exacerbated by a deteriorating global landscape characterized by escalating trade wars, geopolitical instability, and a general flight to safety—conditions demonstrably unfavorable for energy and petrochemical companies.

An immediate sell order is advised to reduce exposure, with ongoing monitoring of global trade tensions and geopolitical stability crucial; a resolution favoring stability could present a future re-entry opportunity.
