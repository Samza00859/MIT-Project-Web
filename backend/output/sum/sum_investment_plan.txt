The plan is to SELL NVIDIA, prompted by escalating regulatory and geopolitical risks centered on sales to China, particularly the recent restriction on H200 chip exports. While acknowledging NVIDIA’s leadership in artificial intelligence and robust growth prospects, the current valuation—with a Price to Earnings Ratio of 45.89—leaves the stock highly vulnerable to these concrete operational headwinds. The bearish signals from technical indicators, like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence, further reinforce the likelihood of a downside correction. An immediate exit is warranted to mitigate exposure to these tangible risks, capitalizing on potential downward price movement as the market adjusts to the revised revenue outlook. The primary risk that could invalidate this plan is a significant easing of U.S. export regulations or a surprising surge in demand from alternative markets that offsets the impact of restricted Chinese sales, thereby justifying a reevaluation of the stock's fundamentals.
