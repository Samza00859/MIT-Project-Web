The plan is to ACCUMULATE shares of Nvidia, capitalizing on its dominant position as the foundational infrastructure provider for the burgeoning artificial intelligence revolution. Despite short-term geopolitical concerns and recent technical consolidation, the compelling evidence of Nvidia’s unparalleled fundamental strength outweighs these near-term challenges. The company’s exceptional financial metrics—including a return on equity exceeding 90% and a net profit margin nearing 56%—reflect a software-like business model justifying a premium valuation within a multi-decade secular growth trajectory. While the China H200 shipment blockade presents a temporary logistical hurdle, it does not fundamentally alter the irreversible demand for accelerated computing, particularly given Nvidia’s proven ability to navigate export controls and the imminent release of the Blackwell platform. The current technical setup, with price holding above key moving averages and a stable base forming between $178 and $193, suggests an attractive entry point, poised for a breakout above $193 resistance, potentially triggered by forthcoming positive guidance or Blackwell-related announcements. Prompt initiation of a position is recommended, recognizing the stock’s building energy for a significant upward move. However, a critical risk remains: an escalation of U.S.-China tech trade wars that could prolong shipment disruptions and trigger valuation compression, requiring vigilant monitoring.
