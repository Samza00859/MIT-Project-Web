The plan is to ACCUMULATE shares based on a confluence of robust technical and fundamental indicators suggesting a sustained upward trajectory. The stock's position above its 200-day Simple Moving Average confirms a persistent uptrend, reinforced by exceptional financial performance—125% year-over-year revenue growth and a healthy 55.8% net margin—which supports the current valuation. Near-term catalysts, including burgeoning demand for AI chips from China and strategic software expansions, promise continued revenue momentum, creating an opportune entry point as the stock tests its Bollinger Lower Band with an approaching oversold RSI. We recommend immediate action at current levels, targeting a move beyond the 50-day Simple Moving Average, with a firm stop-loss set at the 200-day Simple Moving Average of $156.32. However, the primary risk lies in a potential valuation compression stemming from a moderation in AI capital expenditure or increased competitive pressures, which could challenge the high Price to Earnings ratio underpinning this investment thesis.
