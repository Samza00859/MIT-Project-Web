The plan is to SELL, prioritizing capital preservation amidst concerning technical indicators. A compelling argument from the Bear analyst’s technical review reveals a decelerating momentum trend, evidenced by a negative Moving Average Convergence Divergence histogram and crossover, alongside the price approaching the Bollinger Upper Band at $79.79. This confluence of factors—including an overbought Relative Strength Index and proximity to key support levels—suggests a near-term correction is likely. Urgent action is warranted to exit existing positions or avoid further exposure, capitalizing on current strength before a potential decline. However, the primary risk lies in the artificial intelligence growth narrative sustaining the breakout, overriding these technical warnings and invalidating the anticipated correction.
