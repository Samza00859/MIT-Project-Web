The plan is to SELL our position in Advanced Micro Devices due to an unsustainable valuation and emerging macroeconomic headwinds. The prevailing sentiment reflects an overly optimistic market expectation of flawless execution and extraordinary growth, currently evidenced by a Price-to-Earnings ratio of 116.3. While AMD’s presence in high-growth AI and data center markets is undeniable, the recent imposition of U.S. tariffs on AI chips presents a tangible and significant risk, directly impacting both costs and market access—factors not adequately priced into the current premium valuation. Immediate action is warranted to exit existing positions, capitalizing on the likelihood of a valuation correction as the market recalibrates its expectations. The critical risk to monitor closely is the precise impact and enforcement of these tariffs, alongside any indications of decelerating AI chip demand or intensifying competitive pressures that could further erode AMD’s already stretched valuation.
