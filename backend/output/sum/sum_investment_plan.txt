The plan is to HOLD Amazon stock, strategically awaiting improved market conditions before considering further investment. While the long-term potential driven by Amazon Web Services’ AI monetization and robust profitability remains compelling, current valuations appear stretched given near-term technical headwinds and escalating regulatory risks. The research indicates a precarious setup, with bullish momentum stalling at a key resistance level and a demanding price-to-earnings ratio failing to adequately account for intensifying competition and potential antitrust scrutiny. Therefore, we will patiently observe for a pullback towards the 234 support level or a decisive breakout above the 247.38 resistance accompanied by substantial volume, signaling a more favorable risk-adjusted entry point. The primary risk to this strategy lies in an acceleration of regulatory actions or antitrust penalties, which could significantly erode operating margins and trigger a valuation contraction, thereby jeopardizing the projected long-term growth narrative.
