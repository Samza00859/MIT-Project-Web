The asset presents a compelling buy opportunity due to Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited’s (ADVANC.BK) dominant market position and impressive financial performance. Concerns surrounding its debt-to-equity ratio are unfounded, as the company’s robust free cash flow comfortably covers obligations while strategically investing in revenue-generating infrastructure and valuable spectrum licenses. Year-over-year revenue growth of 14.69% demonstrates ADVANC’s ability to capture market share and diversify into high-growth areas like fixed broadband and digital services, positioning it favorably to capitalize on the expanding 5G rollout and escalating demand for data. This strategic shift, coupled with a remarkable return on equity of 30.59%, fuels a clear pathway for sustained growth and significant upside potential, potentially reaching a 20% increase within the next year. Technical indicators further reinforce this bullish outlook, with the price trading above key moving averages and a rising MACD histogram signaling robust short-to-medium term momentum, making ADVANC.BK a prime candidate for portfolio inclusion.
