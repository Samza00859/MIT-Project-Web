Tencent Holdings Limited presents a compelling buy opportunity driven by a confluence of strategic advantages and undervalued market perception. Despite recent short-term technical softness, the stock maintains a crucial position above its 200-day moving average, signaling a resilient long-term uptrend. A pivotal catalyst lies in Tencent’s proactive acquisition of advanced Nvidia Blackwell chips through Japanese cloud services, effectively navigating US export restrictions and securing a vital edge in artificial intelligence development—a sector poised for exponential growth. This move underscores the company’s robust core gaming and cloud businesses, evidenced by record Chinese video game sales and a remarkable net profit margin of 29.40%. Further bolstering investor confidence is a substantial 636 million Hong Kong dollar share buyback program, reflecting management’s conviction in the company’s intrinsic value and commitment to shareholder returns. With strong free cash flow generation and a proven ability to adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes, we anticipate a significant upside potential, projecting a potential return of 20% within the next 12 months as the market recognizes Tencent’s strategic positioning and enduring financial strength.
