The asset presents a compelling buy opportunity due to Cisco’s pivotal role in enabling the burgeoning artificial intelligence infrastructure revolution. Having recently shattered its dot-com era peak and achieved a 25-year high, the market is increasingly recognizing the company’s strategic positioning as the essential network backbone for AI workloads, underpinned by its innovative Silicon One chips and integrated Splunk platform. This fundamental shift, coupled with robust institutional confidence—as exemplified by Morgan Stanley’s recent price target increase to $91—is driving a decisive technical breakout, triggering algorithmic buying and establishing a new, higher trading range. Despite minor short-term momentum fluctuations, the price remains firmly above all key moving averages, confirming the strength of the underlying bullish trend and suggesting a clear path toward substantial upside potential. Furthermore, the projected $188.7 billion workplace transformation market by 2035 provides a sustained tailwind for Cisco’s core businesses, solidifying its long-term growth prospects and making it an attractive addition to any portfolio seeking exposure to the future of enterprise technology.
